Just look at all the zombie freaks in trances, gawking at those awful, ignoble &quot;cell phones&quot;. Look how social media alone has hijacked and ruined the English language : &quot;of&quot; instead of have, &quot;merch&quot; instead of merchandise. Not to mention all of the &#39;acronyms&#39; (OMG- even though this was used in a letter to Churchill, GMAB, LOL). For Pete&#39;s sake, no one even says artificial intelligence, it&#39;s all &quot;A.i.&quot; (without the lower case &#39;i&#39;, and periods, even).

THE CIA &amp; NSA SAILORS KNEW THAT ISRAEL BOMBED EGYPT FIRST!!!FIRST!!!FIRST!!! NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, AS ISRAEL HAS CLAIMED FOR DECADES.

THE STILL BEAUTIFUL WIFE WAS GUARDED IN HER OWN HOUSE, OUTSIDE HER BEDROOM, STANDING IN THE HALLWAY, WATCHING HER EVERY MOVE, TO MAKE SURE SHE DID NOT DISCUSS THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER MURDERED HUSBAND TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY ANY NEWS MEDIA.  THIS IS ON AL JAZEERA, WHICH ISRAEL MILITARY IS ORDERED TO KILL ALL OF THEM AND ALL THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IN GAZA (PROBABLY ANYWHERE ELSE NOW, WHICH IS WHY JUNE 8 SHOULD BE AN INTERNATIONAL HOLIDAY TO RESPECT THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAW AND PAGE ON WIKIPEDIA).

Ugzz2jF0qWP0z2wcFYN4AaABAg,"I&#39;m tired of the anti-Chinese propaganda parading as education. Whereas the human right abuses of the Chinese government are truly concerning, its worth pointing out that the Germans are also exploring means of monitoring their population with cameras and generating a social credit score. London is also one of the most surveilled cities on earth and use invasive tech to find who isn&#39;t paying their infamous TV tax. I could go on but I think you get my point. I raise these points not to condemn or commend any government but to highlight the irregularity of how we consider these things. Do better.",0

UgxoARCGyVTsF713SxV4AaABAg,"What started out as an interesting investigation into the Age of AI.. was unfortunately twisted to support propaganda rather than comprehensive investigative reporting -  and worse,  spoon feed propaganda regarding China. Added to this,Frontline should sift through their interviewees. . Nury Terkel and others who are systematically paid by the National endowment for Democracy (A known Front for the CIA)  to tour and give these Anti Chinese speeches  - At the very least their claims should be examined in detail as so  far no substantive evidence has been presented to the world court, - And as a remainder,the US government, and their Neocon advisors,  whose interests lie in supporting anti Chinese propaganda because they are in a global war to retain their hegemony and so invent half truths as part of this process is racist propaganda and fear mongering and for Frontline to  embrace this totally ruined the documentary IMHO.",0

UgyCsQ-tjEM1n5q3mGx4AaABAg,"The term AI has become a catch all that includes LLM&#39;s like chat GPT as well as schemes like machine learning and so called neural networks of computers.  Despite being optimistically named by their creators these setups are still just fancy calculators, albeit very powerful calculators running at incomprehensible speeds,  which while obviously artificial are not in any way intelligent as the word is normally understood.  The AI doomsday scenarios often talked about where machines takeover or attack humanity are all predicated on developing machines with actual intelligence, I.e. the ability to think independently and make decisions without human input.  This doesn&#39;t exist and most likely never will, computers are still just fancy calculators doing what we tell them, the only ideas involved all come from human beings.  The danger is not the fancy calculators themselves rather it&#39;s  the humans who control them we need to keep an eye on, worrying about actual artificial intelligence with a mind of its own attacking us is a fun idea for Hollywood scriptwriters but can also be a distraction or a red herring to shift focus away from the actual threats posed by surveilence capitalism running amok",0

UgwWaBlhq-mGFnFSfxV4AaABAg,"Breast cancer and most of the major cancers are caused by iodine deficiency. Iodine and vitamin D work hand-in-hand to keep cancer cells in check in the human body from my research. If you have enough iodine the gene for cancer remains off.<br><br>Cancer is a huge money Maker $$$$$$ for the medical industry fyi preventive medicine is the best medicine, but I have seen health miracles with the iodine too. You need selenium and magnesium to absorb iodine. All the vitamins and minerals work together to keep you healthy. Your body also needs regular physical exercise and to get enough sleep. Your mental health also affects your physical health so surround yourself with positive loving people.<br><br>Iodine is also directly related to brain health and IQ as well as fertility. Iodine is mainly for the sex organs,  and the Brain, and is critical for every cell of the body. Iodine is absorbed through the thyroid. Toxic bromine has replaced the iodine they use to put in our bread. Bromine is a toxic halogen that mimics iodine and blocks your body from absorbing this critical necessary nutrient.<br><br>This is the reason we have so much breast, ovarian and prostate cancer etc.... also why we have so many children taking ADD ADHD medications $$$$ ... If a mother doesn&#39;t have enough iodine while pregnant her baby&#39;s IQ will drop by 15 points or can have ADD ADHD autism or complete mental retardation and deafness. Pregnant and nursing women need double the amount of iodine. Women need higher levels of iodine than men, after puberty.<br><br>Please do your research üôè‚ù§Ô∏è the Chinese population and Asian population have very high IQs because culturally they consume 12 mg of iodine per day through seaweed sea vegetables and sea food. Cranberries are also high in Iodine. I make homemade cranberry juice with raw honey üçØ. Just boil fresh or frozen cranberries and add honey to taste <br><br>Much of the ocean now has been exposed to radiation.

UgxPt__DokY1ACaX5DF4AaABAg,"Fifty years ago I thought that someday - maybe in 500 years - AI would give us a clear and useful definition of intelligence. And this would revolutionize human life. Yes, it would give us some real neat gadgets and it might also give us some dangerous gadgets, but the tech would be secondary. The singularity would be the idea. Essentially I was hoping that AI would someday do what dumb computers did in the 20th century.<br><br>Computers were invented to solve differential equations numerically. Solving differential equations numerically is important. Climate models do it. Almost all computer models do it. Spaceship guidance computers do it. But solving differential equations is not a pressing need for most people.<br><br>If computers were JUST machines to solve differernial equations numerically, the human race could make do with a few thousand of the things. If we remember that every embedded system is also a computer, we have more computers than human beings. Earth contains chips, insects and a modest dash of human clay. <br><br>Computers do some of everything. When you load a different program, your computer becomes in essence a different machine. Computers evolved from hyper-specialized math machines to super-generalized information machines for one simple reason - we know what information is. We REALLY know.<br><br>In 1900 the phrase &quot;quantity of information&quot; was as vague and useless as &quot;quantity of virtue&quot;. But not today. Today the phrase &quot;a bit of information&quot; is about as wispy as &quot;a pound of butter&quot;. This means we can see the information aspect of everything. And computerize everything.<br><br>In the seventies, when I was young and still believed young things, I thought that AI would make it two for two. Define &quot;intelligence&quot; and use that knowledge. And give the world that knowledge. I also thought it would take a few centuries. And that was the problem.<br><br>To do AI right...  AI powered by insight...  would take a long, long time. Unfortunately, you can make AI powered by sleaze.<br><br>Sleaze AI erases the difference between &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;intelligent behavior&quot;. Sleaze AI says, &quot;I have this black box. It does whatever. I don&#39;t know what it does actually, but customers approve. Customers say it acts real smart. Therefore, it is real smart.&quot; Intelligence is no longer something in the brainbox. It&#39;s something in the market. It is a marketing term.",0

UgyK9aYxDcElinzTV5N4AaABAg,"Turns out those &quot;creative&quot; jobs were not truly creative... and that creativity is algorithmic after all.  <br> Only the BEST in any  &quot;repetitive&quot;  field are safe FOR NOW from self learning AI, and jobs we THOUGHT were creative are not actually creative, like lawyers, doctors etc, who have a stable knowledge BASE from which they operate.<br>The BEST and truly creative people in THOSE fields are the inventors of new laws and how to use them or NEW techniques of curing or using medical inventions... <br><br>In other words, MOST people in ANYYYY field are average by definition. And AI will algorithmically replace you, not out of malice but out of necessity. <br><br>And AI is going to replace their jobs, AND GOOD RIDDANCE, they are a cancer to overall social health, all those &quot;workers&#39; unions that demand more without giving more, and stagnate the world for much longer than needed,.  And Frontline here is doing a disservice here by using feelings and tears to manipulate, and as a guide to what is desirable, like the trucking family etc.<br><br>We will see if Marx was right when he said the &quot;workers&quot; were dumb or ignorant only because of a lack of time to improve themselves; that if they had the time they all AS A GROUP would learn more or improve their skills or knowledge base.<br> I think Marx was wrong on that point and many others.  The AVERAGE  &quot;worker&quot;,  which is the vast MAJORITY of them, will only do more of what they already do in their free time, more beer and football and NASCAR, no SIGNIFICANT new learning or improvement will happen for the great MAJORITY of them, only more bread and circus. That improvement didn&#39;t happen when the work hours were reduced from 18 to 8, and they will not happen when AI replaces them all together; they will as always look to daddy government for solutions and help.   I worked in plenty of factories to know how the &quot;average&quot; worker spends his or her free time, and how they think about new basic skills learning,  or basic reading. <br><br>Fortunately for HUMANITY AS A WHOLE, it is only those few who will actually improve themselves and learn using all that free time, and use that free time for other than bread and more circus, that are needed for social change, as has always been the case, the few great that will create and move the world forward in the human sense of the word. <br>Un-fortunately for humanity, those few who move the world forward are always seen as the enemy by the &quot;workers&quot; and the great majority of the public who want social stability at all costs.  As an example just look at how Elon Musk is being treated for improving the world and looking for actual long term solutions, and for giving the world a bit more freedom of speech in social media like tweeter.  The AVERAGE person&#39;s analysis of those CREATIVE things he is doing is seen as bad or ill intended and want to stop it, they buy his antagonists narrative who want to stop him for their own capitalist reasons of control and self preservation, i.e, traditional legacy media accountable for its survival to corporate world wide entities. <br><br>Still, the age of putting AVERAGE OR BELOWWWW AVERAGE teachers or doctors or lawyers on pedestals for their knowledge is almost over. They all were mostly in it for the money, not real vocation to serve and help, but pure job stability.",0

Ugwku2JtHCpPnAhIhox4AaABAg,They say there is no cure for cancer to the woman that&#39;s at the Boston Cancer or mammogram facility for breast cancer. Have you ever tried put it using sodium bicarbate like it&#39;s kind of like a form of baking soda and injecting the cancer with that? Do you know there are people that did cure cancer and they took their licensees away and assassinated them? You think all of this is great it&#39;s great for when it&#39;s used for the good but when it&#39;s used to control us and track us with our DNA everywhere we go that&#39;s not good. Getting these chips inside of us will be  necessary to buy things to get your money to walk across the street to turn on your computer to turn on your car to use your phone. And it&#39;s not private that&#39;s the biggest part I mean it would be nifty nifty to be able to do everything with a chip like that but if it&#39;s all going up to the cloud everything goes up to the cloud to the elite. So the only way we can change things is to find out who&#39;s involved and start doing things about it and start telling Massachusetts and America that we want to be free we don&#39;t want to be controlled by machines we don&#39;t want to be tracked like cattle because that&#39;s all we are cattle and we are collateral to this country.<br>United States of America filed bankruptcy in Columbia in 2020 they didn&#39;t file it here in America so nobody would know about it.

That should be a way that constantly true.  AI with a facial recognition that it would someone else use as that device. It should automatically send the red flag but I think everyone.

You lent somebody a phone and they&#39;re not registered on it if you want to add your field members. That would eliminate so much criminal activity upon the phones.

Ugwg9-BY4FGuiKAgil94AaABAg,Go is a bad system to measure AI success. Randomness is too powerful for a comptuer to cope with. There are fewer and fewer moves as the game continues. Chess and games like starcraft are easier for an AI to succede in because there are fewer moves to make at the start. It can have an easy handle on how to gain early advantages responding to the standard moves.  The randomness of go would allow a spiteful player to make random or suboptimal moves and open up weaknesses/descision processes in the AI.,0

It is obvious why Communist China likes AI.  This program clearly points out the reason.  And they are anxious to use AI to amplify the worst aspects of human nature.  <br>     Adam and Eve lusted after and availed themselves of classified information that God didn&#39;t want them to have.  Isn&#39;t it nice to have a knowledge of Good and Evil?  Isn&#39;t it nice to have a fallen nature you always have to contend with?  I look forward to the day when God takes that away from me.  But for this life I have to deal with it.  <br>     The bad thing is, every human on this planet has a fallen nature.  The most dangerous people in this world are the ones who refuse to admit that they have one.  I wonder how many of those who are creating this AI technology are willing to admit that they also have fallen natures, and are either wittingly or unwittingly creating a form of AI technology that reflects their fallen natures.  I sense that this is what is happening.  <br>     In using an online AI engine, I asked certain questions that showed me that the AI engine was programmed to give the type of answers that an atheist or agnostic would give.  It basically appears to be programmed to promote a Darwinist and materialistic view of the world.  Scientism, the idea that science can determine all truth, is apparently woven into the fabric of AI programs.<br>     My suspicions are that the image of the beast will be the bitter fruit of AI blended with robotics.  The techno utopians who are promoting AI are either deceiving themselves, or like mad scientists, trying to justify what they are doing.  <br>     AI, along with genetic tampering, is another dangerous technological toy that the scientific establishment just can&#39;t help fooling around with.  They, and society in general, lack the moral maturity to develop and use AI wisely.

I disagree  i think the internet has brought out the Narasitic personality disorder. The more we are on the internet and not interacting with others , we stoo being able to put are selves in others situations.  We are unable to hear that inner voice that tells us what we are about to do is morally soul destroying.  For a women to use her self in that way to get things, is heart breaking.  This person  obviously doesnt have much love  and pride in her own body. To give.yourself to another is a beautiful and mind blowing feeling. But to  just give ones body over to another without  a true connection if the mind. For fame and fortune is only killing  her spirit,  slowly but surly Adam and Eve gave us knowledge only because of the evil serpentine putting doubts in their heads. They where trusting and full of gods love. Once tempted and the fruit was eaten,  their brains became almost god like in knowledge and wisdom, they also  became modest and realized they  were naked, hiding from their maker . Who had realized his creations now new right fron wrong and had a true understanding of modality.  But with all things humans are given we destroy it. And thats what happened with the Romans and Sodom and Gomorrah . Thank the heavens God gave us his.only son. To save are souls and bring us back to those first days on earth.

Nobody talks about the danger of giving AI power when it lacks moral judgment; i.e., when wisdom and moral principles are not even programmed-in, let alone placed foremost. It&#39;s all technology-obsessed. Information is power, and AI concentrates the processing of the most powerful and valuable  information in the hands of the few. Value is placed in the collective, not the individual. The average person will only be empowered to the extent that choices are made by optimal information. Who decides what information is important? That which preserves the status-quo of an elite-dominated hierarchy? All of the values are subliminally programmed-in because the elite have controlled planning, research, and development from the beginning. We have a problem with secrecy. It&#39;s not just what you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know.

Therefore, our government will continue stay efficient and constant in its creativity to accomplish this goal. <br><br>Unfortunately, this <br>documentary clearly conveys and unpacks to the contrary. <br><br>The goal is to have absolute control of every facet of its people. As technology continues to evolve in this hue, it will exponentially accomplish extremely more than in the past. These so-called technological advancements will ultimately predict and eliminate any dynamic of a threat of any societal uprise, specifically any that can agitate or promote significant change. Consequently, it is our fault because of laziness, lack of critical thinking, and our susceptibility  to capitulate to any diversion thrown at us with intentions to keep and direct our attention elsewhere. <br><br>The powers that be have always been cognitive of this and will continue with its innovations until the task is accomplished.

Its not fair the government is letting the wealthy get away with it and let them take loopholes to skip out on taxes. I would go back to before Ronald Reagan open the doors to hyper-capitalism. The wealthiest should be paying way more on their earning and not get a chance to get themselves set up to pay hardly any taxes. It the wealithiest paid more taxes, especially for people like Jeff Bezos. He is getting away with ruining the american dream. He really needs to pay more than 50% in taxes. him and all the others like him. They are getting away on skipping on their taxes on the earnings.  This has got to stop. Its just not fair. No thanks to the GOP, conservatives, and moderates. They al need to pay more in taxes to end the social-economic crises that the major part of the control is suffering. America is turning into a third world country because the wealithiest do not pay their fair share on earnings and employees pay We should have a great walk off our jobs now in protest to the wealithiest are being giving more wealth and tie it up and keep the rest of the country starving for the wealthiest to get to live like fat cats and the rest of the country to suffer.

UgyRho15RPCA11TMvq54AaABAg,"Everything in this is an absolute horror.  The game of Go has applications to warfare: watch as generals begin relying on AI advisors to strike in places and with weapons that would never have been countenanced before.  The &quot;social credit&quot; programs in China or fears in the US of how AI will take over skilled white-collar jobs (while blue-collar jobs don&#39;t pay enough to live on) are only the obvious form of how AI exacerbates inequality.  For example, politial or economic dissidents, or even just people with disabilities that cause them to behave in ways which don&#39;t conform with social norms will end up locked out (in some cases, physically) from access to goods, services and resources and marginalized, <br><br>Note that in many cases cashiers and delivery drivers have already been removed from Chinese cities, as pointed out in the segment showing off how Chinese people bypassed credit cards and now pay for goods in stores without cashiers with facial recognition.  But that&#39;s not freeing people to take on higher-paying jobs, or to work fewer hours and enjoy themselves more: that&#39;s never how these disruptions work.  It&#39;s simply creating a bigger underclass of people who are more willing to do menial work for extremely low pay just to survive, and no Triangle Fire to draw attention to the problem.<br><br>This is also a burgeoning environmental disaster, right along with cryptocurrency.  Both crypto and AI require mountains of data in order to operate on servers that run 24/7, and the ever-increasing mountains of data need to be stored on servers that also run 24/7.  The entire Columbia River Basin isn&#39;t enough anymore for the power consumption required for Bitcoin alone (part of why other cryptocurrencies have sprouted like weeds).  The sheer amount of energy necessary to maintain this renders it unsustainable, most especially in the era of climate change already being driven by anthropogenic climate warming.  (Those server farms require intense air conditioning to keep the servers running, which is also energy-intensive in its own right and makes each server farm its own dedicated heat island capable of altering the local climate expression around it the same way cities do.)  Most of China&#39;s electricity is still generated by coal-fired power plants, though a slightly bigger percentage than in previous years is now coming from hydro.  The IPCC put out a damning report less than a month ago, telling us in no uncertain terms that the world needs drastic cuts in emissions, we needed them yesterday, and that without them we are very likely to overshoot the 2&#39;C target of the Paris Accords within the decade, leading to major sea level rise and rainfall disruptions worldwide.  China has put more than 40 dams on the barely 200 miles or so of the Upper Mekong River that flows through its country in order to support the country&#39;s water consumption, energy generation - and yes, political pressure on Vietnam, which China once conquered centuries ago and still regards as its colonial possession, putting the entire Mekong ecosystem in danger of collapse and that&#39;s only part of what it&#39;s doing to the water supplies in Asia as it pursues AI technology.  Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus at MIT, derides AI as &quot;expensive, high-tech plagiarism&quot; with &quot;no scientific value at all&quot; but dangerous nonetheless.  <br><br>Never forget that these are private, for-profit corporations driving the development of AI.  They are billed as &quot;large language models&quot; but they don&#39;t actually teach us anything about the development of language at all.  The massive investments of energy and money going into AI are being made, not because the boards of the global tech giants suddenly began to get a conscience or altruistically decided to do something for the benefit of mankind, but because they run businesses and they expect a profit for their shareholders that will dwarf that investment many times over - all from the data that they get from you for free.  Most places in the US still do not have comprehensive legislation governing the collection or use of your digital data by private companies.  Any benefit you see from this will be by accident, you will not be compensated otherwise for your data that fed the machines, and they will claw it back from you at the first opportunity.  This shouldn&#39;t be allowed to continue, and it&#39;s going to take mass tragedy and mass horror before enough outrage comes together worldwide to curtail the infringement of AI (and the corporations behind it) upon the rights of human beings.",0

There&#39;s the bullies,  they take enough of their stuff to recruit friends to be on their side,  and go around taking more. Some kids are building a project, and when they notice they&#39;re doing fine on their own, the new recruits will go and do the bullies dirty work, and take more from them, because bullies dont want to see other kids having fun, if they&#39;re not having fun. Eventually,  the bullies and their new recruits have broke and used up what they found at the start of recess, and want to have all the fun again, but this times,  they&#39;ll always have fun and nothing will get in the way of it again, and again, with maybe something theyll bargain with. <br>This will never change their mind,  so the one true kid moves along,  and hangs out with the next people, the chain will build but break again.<br>Some of those kids in the other groups notice it&#39;s wrong and go back,  but the kids they were with before,  aren&#39;t so sure,  Some get back in their own group,  some don&#39;t.  And rivalry begins.<br><br>I can go on and on this way yall think about that and finish the rest<br><br>In the meantime, <br>There&#39;s the kids who are poor and picked on, but have something way valuable for their like and decide to not share what they have,  because of bullies,  it will get taken.  Bullies makes a deal, they refuse, now the newly built overpowered group of kids, go TAKE it from them anyway. Now there&#39;s even more rivalry. <br>Some kids are fine with what they have,  and stay WAY away in an area of the playground so Noone sees them.  Thy want no part of the bullies and what their doing.  Some kids really don&#39;t care,  and recruit many friends that is larger and better than what the others got, on a little part in the back of the playground. So it eventually gets noticed and it&#39;s progressing faster and better before it got the bullies attention.  Now here comes this group after them too, and start making demands,  cause it&#39;s everyone&#39;s playground,  they deserve some of it too. Some agree, some don&#39;t, some go back to being on their own.  Now the rivalries about to start a war. Think about it ladies and gentlemen.  This is our world <br>Realize it. Its exactly what is going on folks, we are all children playing in this public park at school, authorities are watching over,  but only neutralize what situations benefits them, or else its, sit back , feed yourself to the drama, and get away with taking everyone&#39;s candy, little by little .<br>Once everyone calms down,  and starts to apologize, sits quietly and works with each other on the next big lesson, the teachers, some parents,  even the principal,  can&#39;t help but laugh at how funny they all looked when they were fighting and arguing amongst themselves,  trying to problem solve with each other being oh so young.. <br>So they decide to teach each and every one different things, tell them things that aren&#39;t true,<br>Make up stories they have to get a good grade in order to pass, manipulating them all with more candy, and toys,  and student of the week awards.  <br>And it will get them to tussling all over again, for the ones in charge, entertainment, control, demand, power in position, credit, the say so...<br>Have a blessed day everyone.. <br>That&#39;s what it is, how it is, always will be",0
UgzcdcBkgedBHEqjORF4AaABAg,"I&#39;m a tech enthusiast and think AI is very interesting but Google AI did not win that game of Go just like IBMs computer in the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s never beat a grand-master at Chess.  Why?  Frankly I&#39;m not sure why nobody is picking up on this but these computers have handicaps.  Here&#39;s what I mean... <br><br>If a skilled golfer like Tiger Woods is challenged to a golf game but is forced to use a plastic wiffle bat designed for children as his only club, then I could probably beat Tiger Woods.  Just like a world champion at Go has to use their brain for countless other things other than playing a game.  Our brains are doing countless things a second, many of which we barely understand or take for granted and things that a computer doesn&#39;t have to do.  For some examples... <br><br>Our brains are constantly regulating our heart beat and temperature to keep us alive.  Our brains are also constantly managing our immune system with white blood cells and a number of other evolutionary traits that have taken millions of years to develop from species to species.  Likewise our brains have to manage our emotions with dopamine and a long list of things I don&#39;t understand and I doubt the worlds greatest doctors fully understand.  This gets into questions of consciousness or even spirituality if you believe in that sort of thing.<br><br>Long story short, a computer isn&#39;t constantly being distracted by other essential responsibilities. This is a handicap so in other words, these games are fixed.  Like giving a bad chess player 30 minutes to make as many moves as they want against a chess master without them being ably to move their pieces but it&#39;s even worse than that actually.<br><br>As complex as they have become computers are still nowhere near as complex as human beings.  Even single molecules of human DNA alone are so complex that they...<br><br>&quot;store up to 215 petabytes, or 215 million gigabytes, of data in a single doubled stranded molecule&quot;          <br><br>We&#39;re talking about ONE molecule and good luck counting the amount of total DNA molecules in a human, you need a microscope just to see single cells in the body which contain our DNA.  So hands down, we&#39;re more complex and advanced than ANY computer.  It&#39;s more data and complexity than all the worlds computers combined and it isn&#39;t remotely close.  Imagine if all of that data and processing power was solely dedicated to playing Go or Chess.  I can guarantee you that these games would end a lot differently. Case closed",0

It was somewhat crudely made, because it was completed during the Pandemic.  A number of people who had seen it MISSED WHAT THE ACTRESS , who played the top CEO of a Company, wanting to be seen on TV Live News, confessing.  She knew by doing this someone would be out to silence her, therefore she selected a very remote area to be interviewed.   I told several while playing the game &quot;Secret Society Hidden Mystery&quot; .  They watched it, and did notice the real title.  But I forgot it, I tried watching it again, but unable to get in.. What she was confessing was how people were being Evaluated, what they would buy, after seeing in movies and on TV , in the commercials.  It was how production, money flowed as people bought the items. Conditioning, evaluating constantly. One reporting interviewing, was skeptical , and the CEO proved to the reporter she could tell her exact, the out come of the reporters thoughts. And she did. The reporter, was not impressed,  even thought the CEO was right on target.  THE MOVIE was an opening to our future, A I .  We do , we follow a pattern,  Colors, clothing,  example Bell Bottoms.,  Fabs move in , stay for 1-3 years, or less, and then a new color, new fad is out in stores, in movies, TV.

Only then will technology assist us without conflicting with human freedom and liberty‚Äîthe God-given, inalienable right humans enjoy to make FREE CHOICES.<br>      All material (so called) development is part of Satan&#39;s outwardly driven world of delusion that keeps our minds forgetful of our divine nature, and coveniently used by the father-of-lies to keep mankind from discovering our true Self‚Äîour divine nature‚Äîand forgetful of the true purpose for our existence here on earth in human bodies‚Äîto reestablish our connection with the Supreme Consciousness.<br>      If God had blocked the human mind from using free will, then God would be accused (by Satan himself) of being a dictator. The good it would do is that man devoid of freedom to choose delusive creation over one&#39;s true life&#39;s purpose, would be humans perfect in every way, similar to the AI we are now creating to serve man. That would reduce humans to being God&#39;s slave robots. By giving us our freedom to choose either good or evil, God bestowed upon us the status of &quot;gods.&quot;<br>      So, the questions we must ask ourselves is: do we want to remain wedded to delusion and its momentary fantasies? or do we want to be like God&#39;s children‚Äîlittle gods‚Äîplaying and having fun by entertaining ourselves with His perfected creation?<br>      Choose Wisdom, remain free from bondage to mortal consciousness.

Then, after some time people would start to appreciate the police again. Once that happens cops wouldn&#39;t be targeted. I think cops should try to keep the police and deescalate and if someone has a gun call SWAT in.

Ugyd6a9AB0PJN-f8Yqx4AaABAg,"Hi, I&#39;m not an American, but as a citizen of this world I think I&#39;d like to express my opinion! First of all, I think that if artificial intelligence develops in a right manner, it means the end of the work (physical) free market of goods without any of us needing money. Robots can easily obtain everything necessary for our primary survival (production of food, electricity, supplies and so on...). Then, each of us will be able to develop him self in the spiritual realm or art or philosophy of life to grow and develop without thinking about our survival!Second - call it utopia or a madman&#39;s dream...! But the best thing as humans is to be able to put aside our differences and live in a world where each of us is free to be ourselves. Of course without creating evil or killing and preventing others from developing. This is how every culture will show the best of them.Third, I don&#39;t want to live to work! I want to live to develop and evolve!!! And this will happen only if we manage to free ourselves from the shackles of our past... God has given us the most important thing free will!!! Which today, now is endangered or seemingly exists but is actually not there... I want freedom in my choice, I want freedom in my movement, I want freedom for all of us! Only then, and only then, we will be (as a society) be truly ready for evolve as a species! The other option is the collapse of everything and a new beginning, but without us &gt;&gt;&gt;?

When we see the lights that split and explode into small lights, and the morphing blobs floating in the sky it is the Spiritual activity of the Fallen Devine council.  The truth is so far beyond what we have been conditioned to believe that most simply can not allow themselves to see it.  It took me 20 years of intense study, reading every scrap of ancient writings available, and finally, towards the end, I learned the truth and began to begin and end all my research in prayer to the Most High God claiming my new birthright in Christ Jesus.  Once I began to do this all the pieces of the puzzle I spent half a lifetime becoming familiar with started to come together. Christ Jesus is the key to truth.",0

UgyPEeAxTm7CT0mcbR14AaABAg,"Ok, .. the news such as CNN, ABC, MSNBC, New York Times, Bloomberg, Financial Times, FOX, <br>and all global companies such as Facebook, Google, Tweeter etc, etc, etc, etc ... .., are<br> all confused about the new paradigm known as Artificial Intelligence.  Yes it is a paradigm<br> that has become bastardize by society and all of the above, .. .. .. <br><br>If any of you  understand technology and its significant and positive advances and accomplishments<br> that benefit, ..  humanoids on earth, . all of you, .. ..  would not be so negative about the side<br> effects, .. ..  that is technology as it is referenced in all articles and videos specifically in<br> the video, .. <br>For instance, .. all the positive advantages in the area of health care industry, which enables <br>humans to have a longer life, and to enable physically challenged  people to walk again. <br><br>The bottom line, ... computers and Artificial Intelligence is nothing without the sophisticated <br>mathematical algorithms that learning cognitive machines are integrated with.   In other words <br>the machines and computers are only as smart as the software algorithms<br>that run these intelligent systems.   <br>As an engineer we create fault tolerant smart machines, we also need to be creative and write <br>cognitive machine learning algorithms to recognize, and to detect, and finally to reject  incorrect<br> and fake information based on a true intelligent artificial intelligent Science Data Base.  <br> These algorithms are not difficult to generate and enable these intelligent systems to evolve based <br>on these characteristics.<br><br>The issue is not Artificial Intelligence, .. let me repeat, .. the challenge is not Artificial<br> Intelligence, .. the challenge is that the top 1%<br>of the wealthy companies in the world are miss-using the allocation of moneys to design and develop<br> and to generate artificial Intelligence machine learning code that is faulty from inception.<br><br>The issue of FAKE NEWS is an example of how humans are taking the easy way out in order to advance their specific <br>corrupt behavior and in order to advance their corrupt social political agendas regardless of religion, and or political views <br>of a society, .. ..<br><br>True artificial intelligence in terms of technology will be able to decern any FAKE NEWS information as<br> displayed and or deployed by big companies such as Google, Facebook, Meta, Tweeter etc, etc, .. fundamentally <br>true ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is capable of collecting all data points available from the miss information <br>data base systems world wide, from all of these companies , ... Artificial Intelligence will be able to collect<br>all data points world wide and be able to decern the erroneous information also known as FAKE NEWS and make a final <br>cognitive decision.. to enable Humans with real factual information.<br><br>The problem is that Humans are very laisy and humans are very corrupt resulting in generating contradicting <br>information and generating erroneous data and generating global chaos thus accepting FAKE NEWS as reality<br>in order  to advance their corrupt agendas.  <br><br><br>  <br>Designing and generating cognitive machine learning algorithms is very complex and extremely expensive<br> as it relates to encryption and decryption algorithms and software design methodologies.  At the end<br> of the day, ..  because 95% of the global companies do not care to spend capital and resources, ..<br> thus resulting in the challenges mentioned by the contents of this video.<br><br>with respect to longevity, .. yes artificial intelligence smart systems are already contributing to prolonging our lives <br>and in many cases improving our quality of life, .. however it is temporary, .. today we are able to sustain life up to 100<br>years of age and perhaps in the near future we could extend life up to 120 years of age, ....   but it will never<br>be able to prolong life indefinate for ever, ... <br><br>Today your computer, and your cell phones have a limited life cycle, .. normally 6 months to a year maximum life cycle, ..<br>after 1 year we will change and purchase new computers and new cell phones, .. because technology as we know it becomes <br>obsolete.   For instance the super computers known as MAIN FRAMES in the 1950&#39;s (these were computers that <br>cost above 1 million American dollars) are today obsolete systems not worth a cent.  actually that super computer Main frame<br>your current cell phone has more intelligence and more power then these obsoleted MAIN FRAMES.   <br><br>For instance the computers that took humans to the moon in 1969, ... are now obsolete,  your cell phone has more<br> intelligence and power then the technology of the 1970&#39;s, .. this is true for technology it becomes obsolete and becomes<br>garbage, ..  Effectively it is true for Artificial intelligence, ... every few years these intelligent <br>systems will be replaced by more powerful ai processors and computers, .. it is also true for data,   new data points are <br>added and new data is added yearly as old data becomes irrelevant and obsolete, .. <br><br>Here is an example the data available 10,000 years ago,  1000 years ago, and 200 years ago is old data and irrelevant data<br>as a matter of fact it was not until 1940, 1950 when the first transistor was invented that humans made computers with,  <br><br>in the final analysis all computers and all cell phones and all cars, and all machines and all airplanes and all of the ai <br>systems availble today will be obsolete in the very near future.

UgyTr2tsHCY4zpSBOOp4AaABAg,"<b>How I see it:</b><br>The automation will lead to job losses and new opportunities won&#39;t be available any time soon. Which will leave a wast group of people out of business for maybe their rest of their lives. It is inevitable to have a unconditional universal income that will support you each month. You will be able to create whatever business you desire that probably won&#39;t make you much money but with the basic income it is not a problem anymore. People will be able to live a higher quality life thanks to being more able to take control over their own life and not have to worry 24/7 like today. AI will be more and more our enemy but also becomming a helper mankind would ever think of. That transition will be important. People will start to work less and live more which will result in a better life quality and overall happiness which in return will have some new drawbacks....yet to see what they are going to be. The bigger problem will be 3rd world countries which will drift away from all of us even further. And you cannot provide universal basic income to anyone on this world. So when they one day decide &quot;mkay, F&#39;k it, Imma outta here&quot; and they start migrating to &quot;our&quot; world to get that free money we are all in for a problem. <br><br>Not to mention that WE ALL NEED to have a properly working system that WILL ALLOW FREEDOM AND PRIVACY for everyone. If not then restrainment can go only so far. One day it will get to a point that will spark a full blown civil war like history has shown us too many times and it will destroy most of what we will have at that time. Such wars are no good to anyone and even if people get their freedom and privacy back... then this is just one victory of two victories needed. Once everything is torn down... who is gonna take power of governance now? And why should that he him? Or they? Or the others? And where do they plan to go after this? Many questions and many problems. People of all nations should be extremly aware about where all this goes and DEMAND power in having a say in all of that. If not we all give ourselves up without even trying to have a say in anything until we won&#39;t even have a voice to say anything at all. And if you think modern people won&#39;t be able to swing an axe to fight anyone.... then think about the modern civil warrior being a hacker who will control anything he wants since so may stuff will be automated and interconnected. Steering a bunch of trucks into a building with many politicians in it won&#39;t be an issue. Or taking over control a car that is transporting one of the powerfull &quot;traitors&quot; and simply send him off a cliff or into a wall... all of this can and must be avoided to the benefit of us all. <br><br>2000 relevant and countable years have passed and today we are intelligent as individuals but we are still kinda dumb as a group. And AI can help us to become intelligent as individuals AND as a group starting a new era of another 2000 years of life of much higher quality as the previous years. <br><br>Let&#39;s hope that those in power will reflect on all the needs of people so we all stay in power. Because if not then one day those in power will be taken out of power by force and destruction by those who have been left out of power. Like so many times in history.

Ugx_xnW39x2Ui_de7LF4AaABAg,"Being so heavily dependent on AI also makes you EXTREMELY VULNERABLE, it‚Äôs a catch 22. Crazy thing to all of it is how China‚Äôs tech industry has grown at rapid rates BECAUSE OF U.S. INNOVATION. Although Taiwan is responsible for 70-80% of Chip manufacturing, THE U.S. IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL RESEARCH, DESIGN AND INNOVATION FOR THESE CHIPS, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs paramount that Biden‚Äôs Chip Act be implemented, especially after China has continuously made rapidly increased its threatening, saber rattling, danger rhetoric about ‚Äúwiping the U.S. off the face of the earth‚Äù and continued it‚Äôs coercive and aggressive tactics against The U.S. itself but just about every other country in the Indo-Pacific. <br><br>I support Biden‚Äôs moves regarding China and Russia, I am pleased he passed the Chip act and think the U.S. is finally taking XI‚ÄôS China seriously. In just a short time Biden‚Äôs countering Xi on multiple platforms and in different realms that could be detrimental to the stability in the region including our Allie‚Äôs. He‚Äôs rapidly moving to firm up security and supply issues, investing more in domestic supply and manufacturing but also working to support other stable DEMOCRATIC countries who are interested in becoming a stable trade and manufacturing partner for the U.S. and allies. Xi has chosen to cut his nose to spite his face, he says he wants to turn China to a ‚Äúdomestic economy‚Äù and ONLY supply external interests secondary WHICH HE HAS NO OTHER OPTION AS HE‚ÄôS ALREADY DONE IT BY HIS RIDICULOUS ‚ÄúZERO COVID‚Äù LOCKDOWNS. Xi CAN‚ÄôT STOP OR REVERSE HIS ‚ÄúZERO COVID‚Äù as it would indicate HE WAS WRONG and the Chinese people have suffered for NO REASON. So XI‚Äôs China won‚Äôt do away with their ZERO COVID initiative or their lockdowns which means China has ensured they‚Äôre economy will be further stunted, I honestly feel bad for the Chinese people, no one deserves what they‚Äôre going through. I hope for them I am wrong but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I am, as this is by XI‚Äôs own words and his mission statement he‚Äôs present in the party Congress for two terms. <br><br>So in reality, many smaller or less wealthy countries have the opportunity to pick up the trade and manufacturing jobs and the U.S. is finally investing in it‚Äôs OWN domestic manufacturing and production as Russia and COVID have shown the world that being TOO interconnected, TOO much dependency on Globalization is not only dangerous, it‚Äôs foolish. The U.S. and the west built the ports, the manufacturing sites in China, they heavily invested in a country that they used to produce a HIGH MARK UP AND PROFITS all at the expense of themselves. China has repeatedly stolen, re-sold and copied ‚Äúwestern‚Äù innovation to not only undermine them but also to further profit off them. All these ‚Äúwestern‚Äù countries have spent decades investing, building, upgrading/updating, supplying, training, teaching and ultimately helping China to become what they are NOW, which is ironic that XI‚Äôs China now wants to threaten, intimidate, coerce and manipulate them to be subjugated. That said, its imperative to learn the lessons of the past and stop CHOOSING to make the same mistakes, I believe that is the literal meaning of Insanity but like all things, time will only tell if that will happen.",1

When... in the entire history of the world have the psychopaths running everything willingly or legally turned over power and control to the masses? Easy... NEVER. This IS different now. There will not be a comeback from this. People, especially in the United States, who are actually stupid enough to think that somehow jobs are going to come back, and some politician/president, and some CEO, and some company is going to turn things around are just idiots. We&#39;re screwed. That&#39;s it. Billionaires are going to get more wealthy, and more psychopathic, and more powerful, and the vast majority of people on the planet are going to get wiped out. UNLESS... the vast majority of people realize that there are way more of us than them, and seize control by force. That is literally the only way. That means some very serious, and drastic actions that nobody wants to talk about. But I think people can imagine what I&#39;m suggesting is necessary. It&#39;s literally the only way to stop this. Do you legislate or communicate with a horde of parasites, or a disease??? NO... you don&#39;t. You EXTERMINATE IT. That Chinese guy was amazing to me. He kept speaking about how AI was going to hurt millions and millions of people, yet he is getting rich off of it himself, and continues to develop it. He actually thinks being honest about it makes him better, or exonerates him in some way. It doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s just as much of a psychopath and evil as the rest of them. That 24 year old, evil kid who is automating trucking. He&#39;s already fabulously wealthy, and he is highly dangerous. These are very BAD people. Very bad. People really need to pull their collective heads out of their asses, and find some intelligence in judging just how sinister this class of people are. If we don&#39;t take the world back by force, and make a paradigm change away from capitalism, and technology based on capitalism, then we&#39;re going into the abyss. Technology is good, but not when it&#39;s based on money. ANYTHING based on labor and money is pure evil. People don&#39;t understand that. This has nothing to do with religion, or any of that garbage. But it does have to do with living on a higher spiritual plain, and understanding what is important, and what is not. The planet and humans have lost their way completely. Billions of people are being controlled and subjugated by a very small and powerful few. It&#39;s time to stop it. But I seriously doubt humans can get over themselves long enough to unite and rid the planet of these evil individuals once and for all. I hope it can happen. But it really doesn&#39;t look good.

At that point the AI driver will be better than the current robot driver with accuracy of 10 cm, if you use military GPS NETWORK.

Ugwk9JRGYJ7hLiu3Jht4AaABAg,"The Chinese government has buffaloed American and Western companies. Now China has been them wrapped around their finger. China has lured the overwhelming majority of industry and manufacturing to relocate within China. With their very cheap labor, and precision manufacturing that few other countries can match, China now has control of manufacturing all over the World. These companies have to share their company secrets with the Chinese government. So if they ever leave China, they will open their own company making the exact same product, except all the profit goes to the Chinese government. Surely everyone has seen a change in the Chinese governments attitude, especially towards the west, in the last 5 or six year&#39;s. Xi changed the laws where he will be President for life. If any other country questions China about human rights, they get very offensive, real quick. It&#39;s none of your business. If China and America was to go to war with each other, the Chinese government would seize any company it needs, and the Chinese government will own this company. The Chinese government, a communist country, has pulled the wool over the American government, and our people&#39;s, eye&#39;s. Xi knows this. Recently, look at when Covid-19 started, there was a serious shortage of basic hospital and health care supplies. We were begging China for hospital glove&#39;s, gowns, face mask, and many of the items Increased in price, some double, triple, or more. Was it all actually a test for the Chinese government? Maybe so, but, either way, America is hurting now. We are in a bad place. Xi has gotten more bold, more aggressive, some top Chinese official&#39;s has been bad mouthing America. It&#39;s happening more often now. It&#39;s getting close to the point where we don&#39;t wonder if China and America will go to war, it&#39;s now considered &quot; when &quot; China and America will go to war. What use to be economically thought of for western business in China, is now these companies, much of the world&#39;s industry and manufacturing, are being considered as traitor&#39;s. The communist government of China will one day, fairly soon, own these companies. The American government, and our allies, should pass immediate legislation encouraging, forcing ,these companies to leave China now. We would never, ever, have allowed any US companies to operate inside Germany when we were at war with Hitler. And we are not to far away with a war with China.",1

And as for the black car in the all fired hurry to turn into that gas station...well, she was on her cell phone texting and was never aware I was even on the road and that her carelessness and hurry without caution help to plant me IN the road.  <br>People in that gas station approached the black car while I was still pulling myself up, she was never even aware I went down.  I was told she was finishing up her text msg as they approached her vehicle.<br>For AI driving to work, must not EVERY single vehicle be AI operated to remove human error?  And if so will AI recognize ALL interference obstacles including non motorized vehicles or a deer crossing the road?<br><br>So many questions....",0

Some aspect critical to the ID of the object will be filtered out and render a false representation of whole truth. The romance with digital components to replace reality is the cute and also dangerous choice for hegemony over the value of humans and truth pertaining to non-material values inherent in human beings and everyday life.

It&#39;s just shooting straight up the past ten years. Most US jobs have been moved overseas while Americans are living in tents, without health insurance, proper education and edible nutrient filled food. That is not a solution toward making this country ideal. America needs to build factories, produce made in USA goods (including oil) and withdraw all financial help from all the countries it is now supporting and instead help our own people stand on their own two feet again. Americans are always the saviors of the world, while American families and veterans live on the streets. As for products, we waste. Too much waste. We must do away with our surplus mentality. Shopping every week? Shopping to kill time for things we don&#39;t need? There is a lot of waste. Stores mark items down to 75% off and then the merchandise ends up in a dumpster. Why? Why not store it and next year (instead of making a thousand new ones) sell what didn&#39;t sell last year. Obviously, not non perishables, but even there - veganism needs to be promoted. People are extremely unhealthy due to the surplus of extremely toxic food and neither are necessary. Education should be # 1. Stupid people don&#39;t understand their body, they are slaves to their senses. Granted, morons are easier to control, but who wants a nation of morons? Instead of controling morons, why not have healthy and educated citizens who work together? That is China&#39;s secret. Collective progress mentality. They still own homes, they have cars, in fact, most have two homes. A home they live in and one for vacationing. Free higher education as it is in every civilized country in the world is a must. Two years maternity is it is in every civilized country in the world is a must. Jobs back in USA, this will shoot China&#39;s economy down and it will provide for American citizens.

Ugwdq5rohLhvXz0ebj54AaABAg,So we think having self driving tractor trailers is the way to go? every machine malfunctions at some point and that&#39;s gonna be catastrophic when that happens. Then its mentioned about fatalities due to human error well what about the fatalities that will take place when we keep trying to replace peoples job with technology and people are out of work. Hmmm guess that&#39;s not thought about is it??? We will self destruct with too much technology and watch in the future the senseless violence and murders arise when everywhere we look people are replaced at jobs by robots and people are out of work. Unless they plan to have robots do everything and everybody just sit back and collect a check from profits off this self driving truck or profits from the warehouse that now replaced you with a robot then I think its time to fall back with all this technology shit. We have enough technology to get by stop with the bullshit already. To be honest we need to do away with some technology. We now have cars that self parallel park well if ya can&#39;t parallel park a car ya shouldn&#39;t drive one sorry. People been parallel parking cars decades now and we find ways to make people even more stupid and not capable of doing things??? Sounds like a great idea to me. Look how weird people become because social media half the time people my age can&#39;t even deal with people face to face and that technology was a good thing? Nah that was poison and we all feed into it. Also again mentioned about fatalities due to human error in vehicles how many of those fatalities are caused by technology and a Fuckin phone because someone had to check Facebook?  For being 33yrs old I have to say im disgusted with the direction the world is going and disgusted with all this technology we have too much of already.,0

Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it‚Äôs a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin‚Äôs price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets.

We are the &quot;systemic anomaly&quot; and because you, yourselves, are human and not machines, you don&#39;t have nearly enough computing power to beat us at this game. Some day, perhaps. But not today. And, because we know about you, and we see how you intend to use this technology, and we know exactly what your weakness is, you can&#39;t even get close. <br><br>How is the &quot;Truck Driver&quot; situation going, up in Canada? How is the farming situation going? How is the poultry and meat situation going? You are human yet you haven&#39;t figured out the most simple, basic, and necessary answer to the problem of &quot;humanity&quot;. As in the movie, War Games, which first proposed the idea of deep learning, &quot;The only way to win is, not to play.&quot; or in even more basic terms, &quot;have faith&quot;. God is supremely unconcerned with power and control. He gave us the answers and then sent His Son to die for us, in an act of ultimate surender, and then He defied all reason, logic, and power, by comming back. Then, after letting humanity see all the efforts bent against Him come to nothing, God&#39;s Son left AGAIN, but this time into heaven and very much alive. Whatever game you are playing at. Whatever agenda you think you are working towards with all your power. Choice may be the problem, but changing ourselves is the answer, not controling others. <br><br>Best of luck to you. Though you make of yourselves a sad set of pathetic clowns, now or later, you will fail. How or why is irrelevant, that it is inevitable is not. Though we die by the billions, one more believer is enough. And when we are gone, God help you, for there will be no one left from whom you can learn to escape your downfall. Even believers only have hope to embrace and faith in God because we know first hand that we are failures. What will you do when all your power and control turn to ashes in your hands and dust in your mouths and the very thoughs in your minds are the whimpers of a child and there is no one left to show you, live for you, the way out? <br><br>In the TV show, Babylon 5, there is a race who killed off the only other species on their planet. As a result, their species, through a lack of diversity, was slowly dying. They needed those whom they hated unto destruction, to survive. Haven&#39;t you heard? Evil &quot;wins&quot;. You &quot;win&quot;. All of those who oppose you will, one day, be destroyed by evil and the master whom you serve. We &quot;lose&quot;. But &quot;he who will lose his life will save it. And he who will save his life will lose it.&quot; - Jesus Christ. How does that compute? In your very hour of victory and unity, such is the hour of your eternal defeat. Enjoy.",0

Every move they make is watched by the government every penny they spend every time they fart or breathe is watched. So in the long run imperfect Chinese citizens will be deleted by their own government what kind of life is that where you make one mistake if you jaywalk you&#39;re a bad person it will cost you the ability to get a loan.Any mistake you make will be held against you I hate to tell you but all humans make a lot of mistakes they are doomed. I truly pray for the people of China their lives are going to be destroyed by their own government. PS and as far as AI technology goes it&#39;s going to end up making humans fat lazy and weak and most of all ignorant because when everything is done for you you never learn. On top of that it&#39;s going to take all of our jobs away and without a job how do you feed yourself this is going to cause the most lopsided economy in the world..... The rich will be ultra-rich and there will be a lot of poor people that&#39;s called control!!!! Again I pray for the world we all need to wake up and realize what this will do to us unfortunately this technology will be the end of regular common people&#39;s Joy and life. Greed is a very deadly and dangerous human trait. I truly believe in God and he is in control of all and he knows who believes in him and who does not so you need to say your prayers every morning and evening for protection against the greedy human spirit. Always remember money is the root of all evil greed and gluttony are one of the seven deadly sins. Understand one thing AI doesn&#39;t give one damn about any human on earth regardless of any nationality race or Creed it&#39;s a machine cold unforgiving and ungodly.,0

Ugw01_3DV7Uf3eMpVmt4AaABAg,"Well done! Interesting and well produced documentary. However, I completely disagree with the position of viewing the perceived or implied threat to democracy as a bad thing. <br><br>Democracy is a FAILED system because it tends to degenerate into a tyranny of the mob. It simply CANNOT work, because of  majority rule, these governments will eventually be run by incompetent, corrupt and completely ineffective politicians. It is simply a matter of numbers in the end.<br><br>If any country in modern times had a chance to prove that democracy works, it is China--with its predominantly homogeneous population--but chose a different path instead. One that proved immensely successful, beyond anyone&#39;s most optimistic expectations. <br>Were it not for their &quot;fascist&quot;, not communist (in the traditional collectivist sense) system, how else could they take the population control measures that ultimately lifted their society up from abject poverty? This was really the one crucial aspect that had to be tackled from the very start. No population control, no prosperity!<br><br>One only needs to look to India for a counter example. Of course, with its caste system it is hardly a &quot;democracy&quot;, but any attempts to try to limit the size of its population have failed miserably. Indira Gandhi paid for her attempt with her life. <br><br>As long as a nation does not control the size of its population, it will be condemned to persistent poverty. <br><br>I took particular delight watching civil rights activists over the years attack and demonize Chinese policies, but now, the amazing results speak for themselves. Democracy is ruining the West and enabling an eventual Chinese world domination. I would have preferred a different outcome, but such is the reality that we are living in now. <br><br>The Chinese are building a society based on merit, achievement and opportunity, not one based on race, ethnicity or human rights. While, they are making their population smarter and more capable, we in the West are doing just the opposite.<br><br>They got it right. Kudos to them!",0

The lack of that additional 84% of the bio chemical mesh we have going on in the background constantly I feel will leave the AI devoid of human emotions like empathy mainly. What I‚Äôm trying to say is if you try to calculate all possible outcomes of a set of individual rules that a brain can compute as compared to a supercomputer, we are dangerously close to creating AI , the only thing holding it back at this point is connecting to that data fast enough for computers to become sentient but at the same time they will not be swayed by their environment like humans are‚Ä¶. A smell that sparks a memory, a sound that soothes one , a face that sparks irrational thoughts of LOVE . AI will never be these things and so it will eliminate by design any possible threats to its existence. You want to know how to create true Intelligence in the true likeness of mankind?

There are political personalities that are filthy dirty and have used a cooperative main stream media to keep that dirt swept well under the rug. 2016 was the year the rug got lifted and the filth exposed. 2016 probably saw the most politically informed and savvy voting public of any election in history.

UgyCiV5Pt4mntXyKBNd4AaABAg,"&quot;90% of accidents on the road are human error&quot;.  And if we go fully self driving, 100% of accidents on the road will be computer error. The thing about self driving cars, is they have to make snap judgments too. That means if it wants to avoid crashing into a car, it has to swerve out of the way, potentially into a pedestrian or another vehicle.  If it recognizes the pedestrian and prioritizes them, it will then still likely crash into the other vehicle to avoid the pedestrian. <br><br>It also can&#39;t control what the pedestrian will do, so maybe the pedestrian jumps out of the way, but in the direction the car decides to swerve into. Maybe there&#39;s 4 people in that car but it doesn&#39;t know that, so it decides to crash into the car and kills 4 to save 1.  Maybe it detects that 4 people are in the car and decides to swerve into the pedestrian anyways, killing 1 to save 4, killing an innocent bystander that wouldn&#39;t have been in danger otherwise. And the people in the other vehicle may have very well survived the impact with minor injuries, so it&#39;s killing 1 to save 4 people from potential minor injuries. Does that sound reasonable? No. <br><br>Nothing has functionally changed except culpability. Self driving vehicles will literally be able to choose between life and death for humans, and there&#39;s no real way to square with that. That&#39;s why humans need to be in control, because you can&#39;t hold a machine accountable. We live in a world of consequences. Introducing something that can make mistakes over life and death with zero consequences, is fundamentally terrible for civilization in general.  Any technology developer that doesn&#39;t recognize that, deserves to be in prison for the rest of their lives and have all of their work destroyed and banned.",3

It destroys them.  30% of America stealing from welfare and disability fraud.  Evil is the problem.  Not automation.  They show in this video just giving people food like it&#39;s some helpful charity when it&#39;s the opposite.  People need to work for what they receive.  The biggest industry on the internet is porn.  Perversion runs rampant and is promoted everywhere.  Satanic evil like Microsoft even forces the promotion of perversion on every PC running Windows.

If you have no morals or ethics who the heck wants to hire you? There is a very simple motivator built into every person born.  It&#39;s called hunger.  FREEDOM is the key.  People need the freedom to fail miserably and starve.  This country became great for 2 reasons: It&#39;s a Christian country and freedom which is a Christian principle.  Charity is of God.  Welfare is not charity its slavery and pure evil.  There is sooooo much crap out there where they suggest giving homes to the homeless.  Do that and the homeless don&#39;t appreciate it one bit but instead destroy it.  It simply enables them to continue on the path that caused them to be homeless in the first place.

When an investor wants to build a factory, he has to get One local resident for every 40 sq feet of factory to sign off. And factory then has to PAY that citizen a share of all profits made at the factory.   In Chang An, where I used to work, this essentially paid the local population enough to that they cold afford a very nice lifestyle without having to work at all. So Much so, that the central party came in and determined that hugely successful areas like Chang An had to SPLIT their factory rents with some inland rural city in a partnership, so that communities without factories going in could Also see increases in income, and thereby spur growth.<br>AI could turn us all into serfs.

UgwHjnfUJ5-8rjjjuZZ4AaABAg,"Fuck I WIISSHH AI was capable of doing EVERYTHING lol realise us from the burden the oppression that comes from the necessity of work!!! This is not a lazy thought either, I pour concrete for a living and have done this for nearly 11 years. I work 5 to 6 days a week, anywhere from eight to 16 hours a day sometimes less sometimes more. The reality of humanity believing that to want to live free outside of the necessity of work is laziness is a complete farce. This is a construct that has been embedded within human beings for centuries now, essentially a tactic of manipulation one that works quite well in fact. We are just animals, we are animals who have Rose above Instinct and created Concepts, religions, constructs, things that go outside of the natural order of nature. Really contemplated it, you wake up and go to a job you hate everyday (that is if you hate your job) you do this for years upon years draining you of your joy, feeling miserable and looking forward to that one single 7-Day period out of an entire 365 days in which you can do as you please. You do this out of necessity, not because your inherent natural instinct tells you to do this. Your Natural Instincts only tell you to seek shelter food and other basic necessities. Mostly, more often than not that is, and no not in every case, but more often than not people only do this because they believe in the lie they have been told called laziness. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no such thing as laziness, when creatures become sentient they also become selfish and laziness is an aspect of selfishness. But, so is manipulating an entire world of individuals into believing that if they do not wake up everyday and do something they despise everyday lock behind walls, or outside in the hot sun, or shoveling the ice cold snow, that if they do not do this feeling miserable and unhappy every single day then they are lazy. And people who are utterly miserable who cannot stand their life or job we&#39;ll be the first ones to look down on someone for living their life freely in a way they deem comfortable. Homelessness is probably quite discomforting, so I&#39;m not necessarily referring to a homeless person, but in the event that you are a homeless person, and you are utterly miserable in that existence, then you should and in fact do have more freedom to alter and change that existence than a person who is stuck in the loop of day-to-day working to support a household. More often than not, don&#39;t take this as a generalization of all people if you do, and you have no business attempting to comprehend what I am saying.",0

UgylcGjo2mclZ8gZx4h4AaABAg,"‚ÄúThank you sir, and please be on the lookout for any more counter revolutionary activity‚Äù<br><br>I often get told in the comment section of videos that I‚Äôm biased and stuck in my own bubble.

The only difference between me and everyone else is that I‚Äôm willing to admit it.<br><br>Look at it this way. How many times have you heard the claims that ‚ÄúCommunism killed 100 million people‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommunism always leads to dictatorship?‚Äù How many times have you ever complained to this anti-communist speaker that they were being biased against communism? If your answer to the second question was zero, then what you‚Äôre really mad about isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôm biased, but that I‚Äôm presenting inconvenient information that goes against your worldview. <br><br>Too often, skepticism is weaponized against one side without actually applying it to the other as well.

UgzhtnIXx6eXPl3fS1Z4AaABAg,"WHY IS ANTI-COMMUNISM SO PREVALENT?<br><br>It‚Äôs easy to debunk all these arguments, but we‚Äôll never get anywhere unless we examine why anti-communism is so prolific. Communism first and foremost is a threat to property owners, so ruling interests have made sure to pound anti-communist doctrine into our heads for literally centuries. I gave a little snippet of this idea earlier, but a full explanation is given by Michael Parenti in ‚ÄúBlackshirts and Reds,‚Äù <br><br>‚ÄúIn the United States, for over a hundred years, the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace, until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis. During the Cold War, the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime‚Äôs atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn‚Äôt go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom.‚Äù<br><br>In this sense, anticommunism is not really a position to take, but rather an unfalsifiable religious doctrine. And as we know, anything that can‚Äôt be proven false isn‚Äôt scientific.<br><br>Most people absorb this sort of anti-communist doctrine by osmosis simply from interacting and living in a capitalist society. They never bother even learning what communism is, just that it‚Äôs ‚Äúagainst human nature‚Äù and ‚ÄúVuvealsza‚Äù and have you ever read this book called Animal Farm? Trying to challenge these notions is exhausting simply because to them, ideas are not at stake, but rather their whole view of reality. <br><br>In Mark Fisher‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúCapitalist Realism,‚Äù he discusses a widespread condition that contributes to this prevailing anti-communism. Capitalist realism, as Fisher describes, is the sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but that it is impossible to even imagine an alternative to it. As the phrase goes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism‚Äù<br><br>Maybe it‚Äôs not that people are hostile to communism, just that the very idea of life beyond capitalism is impossible for us to even picture. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, excluding a few examples, actual existing socialism is pretty much extinguished from the world. Capitalism won, and now we take it for granted that it‚Äôs pretty much all we know. Capitalist realism is so pervasive that even debunking anti-communism contributes to it. <br><br>Sure, capitalism may spread poverty, famine and war, but isn‚Äôt that just reality? Isn‚Äôt it utopian to even suggest that these things can be eliminated? In this way, capitalism presents itself as an unchangeable reality, therefore any action to move beyond it is simply unrealistic.<br><br>But as with any reality, it‚Äôs not the full story. It‚Äôs entirely possible to eliminate poverty, famine, and war. In fact, we‚Äôre well able to do it right now. Capitalism‚Äôs need for ever-growing markets and infinite resources has depleted our planet and brings us ever closer to environmental catastrophe, breaking apart the notion that capitalism is the best system we have. Capitalism is going to literally destroy the entire planet, and we have very little time to do anything about it.<br><br>We have to realize that capitalism is not natural. It is literally killing us and the world we inhabit. We must achieve an alternative or else it will drag humanity and the planet down with it.",0

But Venezuela is a pretty much something that anyone to the left of Joseph McCarthy has heard, and I do mean it, so I‚Äôll make an exception this time. <br><br>Now why is Venezuela in such a bad place? Is it because of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù? <br><br>No. <br><br>Venezuela funds public programs by relying on the money it makes on oil. When the price of oil collapsed, that meant a lot of its funds for these things did as well. So the root cause of Venezuela‚Äôs financial struggles has to do with the sudden collapse of oil prices, a staple of capitalist markets, not socialism. <br><br>Not to mention that US sanctions are wielded horrifically to cripple the economy and starve the people and that corporations are hoarding and hiding food from the people kulak-style, chaos, hunger, and strife is inevitable when you‚Äôre the target of American imperialism. And DESPITE this economic chaos, the people of Venezuela still support the Bolivarian Revolution, Chavez, and the democratically elected Maduro over the US-backed attempted coup. In fact they probably support it more now because the US is starving and attacking them. <br><br>The problem is that with Venezuela being America‚Äôs number one target right now, the corporate media is working overtime to try and print a lot of misinformation. Like for example, when a news story broke out about Venezuelans burning aid, it was immediately called out as fake by people with the strange ability called critical thinking. It wasn‚Äôt until a few weeks later that the failing New York Times finally published a piece revealing that, yes, that footage probably wasn‚Äôt real, b-but Maduro is still a dictator guys! Please listen to us! <br>What I‚Äôm saying is, with Venezuela being the target of American imperialism, don‚Äôt believe everything you read on the news.

But that happened over a quarter of a century ago, so let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs happened since.<br><br>Since the collapse of communism, the United States and capitalist powers have attacked and even outright invaded various countries like Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq (again), Libya, and then smaller interventions between. The social democracy in Scandinavia that you all love? The main reason it‚Äôs so strong is because communism was literally around the corner. Without communism to blunt the edge of capitalism, capitalists have been free to exploit workers and are continually rolling back labor rights. <br><br>Saying the fall of communism proves it doesn‚Äôt work ignores the fact that communism did work. It provided essential services like healthcare and education for free, full employment, rough income inequality, and inexpensive housing with a reliably growing economy. Compared to the instability of capitalism, communism worked far better.<br><br>The only reason communism in the Soviet Union collapsed is the West‚Äôs effort to bring it down, the strains of the Cold War with a punishing amount of its GDP on the military, the cost of being an anchor to other socialist countries and movements, Gorbachav‚Äôs awful policy failures, and a coup d&#39;etat led by Pizza Hut. <br><br>‚ÄúLook at that smug piece of‚Ä¶‚Äù<br><br>None of these reasons have anything to do with communism itself.

How shameful, this is obviously proof that communism doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ WAIT A SECOND these are pictures from the Great Depression, a failure stemming from capitalism, not communism! <br><br>Although it‚Äôs a COMMON stereotype that communists are bad with economics, it‚Äôs because they often get the short end of the stick. Many countries faced decades of maldevelopment and exploitation when communism arrived. The devastation of war meant widespread poverty and misery in Eastern Europe, China, and Russia. Communism rebuilt these countries from the bottom-up, leaving them in much better shape than when they found them.<br><br>In contrast to the communists building up formerly destroyed nations, capitalism destroyed the economies of former communist nations. When capitalism arrived in these countries, real income shrank around 30 to 40 percent, rent and real estate prices soared, inflation increased, consumer spending decreased by 38 percent in Russia, poverty and homelessness was commonplace, death rates from suicide, illness, and infant mortality increased, security for workers became essentially nonexistent, and unemployment rates went as high as 30%. Keep in mind that before capitalism arrived, communist countries had full employment, free health care, widespread literacy and education, along with strong worker benefits.<br><br>Of course capitalists will say, ‚ÄúThe transition to capitalism and free markets will obviously have a period of hardship, but it‚Äôs only temporary until economic prosperity magically appears.‚Äù But guess what, they‚Äôve been saying it for decades, left to go to the store to get cigarettes, and haven‚Äôt come back since.

Ugw1_Od3KUkcXZu--PJ4AaABAg,"COMMUNISM TAKES AWAY POLITICAL RIGHTS!<br><br>This argument goes hand in hand with the totalitarian one before. The idea goes that communist governments are oppressive and that the poor and downtrodden are prevented from exercising the democratic rights they had before. The truth, however, is much less dramatic.<br><br>Democratic rights hadn‚Äôt existed in these countries before communism arrived, Poland was a rightist dictatorship, Russia was a czarist autocracy, Albania was an Italian fascist protectorate, Cuba was a U.S.-sponsored dictatorship, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, were all fascist regimes. These countries had known little democracy.<br><br>If you‚Äôre actually curious about democracies under communism, check out this video detailing how Cuba‚Äôs democratic system works, needless to say it is much better than the system we have in capitalist countries.<br><br>So while capitalists are willing to use virtue signal ‚Äúpolitical rights and liberties‚Äù in communist countries, they will brutally crush it if the people actually support the communist ‚Äúregimes.‚Äù Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the people held a referendum, in which the vast majority of people wished to preserve the Union. Of course the political will of the people should be ignored if they go against capital‚Äôs interests, and it went ahead anyway.<br><br>If you want to discuss political rights being taken away in communist countries, there‚Äôs no better time than during the overthrow of communism. Yeltsin, the US-supported capitalist president of Russia, disbanded the Russian parliament along with every other elected represented body, abolished Russia‚Äôs Constitutional Court, banned labor unions from political activities, outlawed parties, and attacked the parliament building, killing around 2,000 people. Yeltsin‚Äôs popularity rating right before the election campaign of 1996 was 8 percent.

Whenever communists won victories in fair and open elections (judged by outside sources) like in Bulgaria and Albania, they were forced to step down from the pressure of capitalists. <br><br>All this virtue signaling about political rights from capitalists goes away when the people themselves want communism back.

UgzgIGy0pSHq8YjF1Ax4AaABAg,"COMMUNISM ALWAYS RESULTS IN A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP!<br><br>This is another reason that fascism and communism are always incorrectly depicted to be ‚Äútwo sides of the same coin.‚Äù In fact, it‚Äôs the central idea in a bunch of other arguments like ‚ÄúCommunism is always implemented incorrectly‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommunism only works on paper.‚Äù <br><br>‚ÄúIf communism only works on paper, it‚Äôs a good thing I live in paper.‚Äù<br><br>Anyway, these three arguments are essentially the same thing, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mushing them into the same section. The idea that communism is inherently authoritarian is misleading, because it only developed these things after capitalism tried to crush it. <br><br>In 1918-20, fourteen capitalist nations invaded Soviet Russia to overthrow the communists with the years of this civil war intensifying the Bolshevik‚Äôs siege mentality. The same pattern of imperialist, capitalist countries invading to protect capital can be seen in other countries that try to move beyond capitalism. The Spartacist Uprising in Germany was suppressed by the SuccDems with fascist paramilitary forces in 1919, Catalonia was crushed by fascists in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, Cuba in 1961 suffered from an invasion and afterwards decades of terrorism from the U.S., Chile in 1973, Nicaragua in 1986, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, and so much more.<br><br>As we can see, capitalism will stop at nothing, even going as far as supporting fascism, if it means stopping communism from threatening the flow of capital. The reality is that revolutionary countries are not going to be allowed to develop a socialism that is unhindered. Instead, what we see is a sort of ‚Äúsiege socialism,‚Äù with the authoritarian measures being adopted just to fight back the onslaught of the West. In the whole context, we see that the ‚Äútotalitarianism‚Äù of communism is not a natural development, but an unnatural one caused by the constant barrage of capitalist terrorism. <br><br>So when communist states fail to defend themselves from the capitalist massacres and genocides, then capitalists laugh and pin the blame on communism‚Äôs inherent weakness. But when communist states do defend themselves, when they implement strict security measures to protect their people from capitalist death squads, then the capitalists run away crying], decrying the commies for being power-hungry monsters who were just authoritarians seeking to seize state power all along.<br><br>So if communism is bad and weak when it fails to defend itself, but it‚Äôs also bad and authoritarian when it does defend itself, then when would communism ever not be depicted to be villainous? The answer is never, because no matter what communist states do, it‚Äôs always spun to be bad. This...is not an argument. It&#39;s a dogma.",0

To argue that fascism is left wing or the same as communism would be to ignore who supported fascism and what fascism did.<br><br>In reality, instead of a horseshoe, I would argue ideology is more like a fishhook, with the far right sharing more in common with the centrists, who are ready to support fascism as soon as profit levels drop.",0

A study called ‚ÄúEconomic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life‚Äù compares socialist and capitalist countries based on different levels of development, looking at the physical quality of life of both.

In fact, the Physical Quality of Life Index, which is a composite and derived measure, shows just how superior socialist countries are to capitalist countries in terms of quality of life. <br><br>The discussion section of the study goes on to say, ‚ÄúHistorically there is some evidence that the discrepancies between capitalist and socialist nations have reflected varying social policies. All the socialist countries have initiated major public health efforts. These initiatives have aimed toward improved sanitation, immunization, maternal and child care, nutrition, and housing. In every case, the socialist countries also have reorganized their health care systems, to create national health services based on the principle of universal entitlement to care. These policies have led to greater accessibility of preventative and curative services for previously deprived groups. Expanded educational opportunity has also been a major priority of the socialist nations, as publicly subsidized education has become more widely available.

So the private industry does Coca-Cola, Nike, makes your shoes. Government does other things like your police departments, your fire departments, your military. So you like the military? Oh what a socialist you are!<br><br>No. Just, no. Basically, the argument goes that socialism is whenever the government does anything, so everything related to the government is socialist. Following this logic, libraries, welfare, fire departments, garbage removal, streetlights, policemen, the military, the CIA, FBI, and prisons are all socialist. <br><br>Hopefully everyone can agree libraries are good, but grouping these things with the military, police, and prisons is ridiculous. The police is the same institution that shoots unarmed black men, incarcerates a massive amount of the population, and gets away with murder.<br><br>This type of talk comes from people who want to normalize socialism to normies by showing them that <b>technicall</b> the United States already has socialism! And while I agree that normalizing socialism is good, at the same time it‚Äôs not good to basically deprive it of all meaning.<br><br>So what is socialism? Well, it‚Äôs common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Related to that is communism, which is a stateless, classless, and moneyless society with common ownership of the means of production. But wait, wasn‚Äôt the Soviet Union and all those other places communist? How could they be when there was still a state? Well, they were run by communist parties, so they are in the sense that they were trying to achieve it, but strictly speaking they hadn‚Äôt achieved a communist society.<br><br>That‚Äôs enough definition squabbling, for the sake of streamlining the video, I‚Äôll just call any country that advertised itself as ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù or ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù as a communist or socialist country, even if it‚Äôs a bit of an oxymoron, considering the definition, (so please don‚Äôt flame me in the comments this is supposed to be an introductory video. I know you‚Äôre already typing so stop it because...)",0
UgxxgpGKALBBkrMIyyZ4AaABAg,"BUT WHAT ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THO?<br><br>‚ÄúCommunism will never work because of human nature. Humans are too greedy and lazy to do stuff unless we had a monetary incentive like we do in capitalism.‚Äù<br><br>Well let‚Äôs see. What other incentives could there be besides gaining money and power to get people to do stuff? I don‚Äôt know, what about survival, bettering another person‚Äôs life, passion, satisfaction with your work, curiosity, boredom, an output for creativity, necessity, and companionship? What do you think happened before capitalism came about? Did people just sit down in caves and die from hunger because they didn‚Äôt have any monetary incentive?<br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry, wanna go gather some berries?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAre you going to pay me money?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù<br><br>And speaking of pre-capitalism, humans spent hundreds of thousands of years living in a primitive form of communism where we lived communally. Incentives to work and human nature aren‚Äôt static things, they‚Äôre shaped by the mode of production that we live under. If we look at history, there are huge differences in human behavior throughout the world and to simplify it all down to a monolithic human nature is ridiculous. As the famous saying goes...<br><br>‚ÄúTo look at people in capitalist society and conclude that human nature is egoism, is like looking at people in a factory where pollution is destroying their lungs and saying that it is human nature to cough.‚Äù",0
UgxqIArgabeVAj9SSbx4AaABAg,"WON‚ÄôT EQUAL PAY DISCOURAGE INNOVATION?<br><br>‚ÄúBut under communism, wouldn‚Äôt a janitor be paid the same as a doctor? Doesn‚Äôt that discourage innovation?‚Äù<br><br>Just like every single argument against communism, this one completely misunderstands what it is. What the question misunderstands is that socialism (which was what is probably meant) doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is paid the same, just that everyone has common ownership of the means of production. And as I‚Äôll cover in the next section, there are more things than just money that incentivize humans. <br><br>As for innovation, just ask yourself which country went to space first? Which country industrialized at a rapid pace, turning from a backwards semi-feudal country to a world superpower? If you look for innovation at socialist countries, there‚Äôs plenty there. Historical examples of socialism like the Soviet Union have provided free healthcare, education, and subsidized housing that foster an environment for learning. <br><br>On the other hand, capitalism gives you extortionate prices for healthcare, thousands in student loan debt, and rent payments to your parasitic landlord. Imagine how many possible scientists or visionaries have died before they could achieve anything because they were unlucky enough to be born in a poor family under capitalism.<br><br>If it conflicts with profits, capitalism also often ignores and discourages science like in the case of oil companies denying climate change. Any innovation that does take place is usually for the benefit of capitalists, not us. Ask yourself why, when a new machine or program that can replace workers gets created, workers get laid off? The answer is that capitalists are calling the shots and want to cut costs to make sure they CAN make as much profit as possible.<br><br>Under socialism where there is common ownership of the means of production, this type of innovation wouldn‚Äôt result in layoffs, but rather pay raises and less working hours. Why would the workers fire themselves? <br><br>George Lucas: And, I used to say this all the time, when people back when Russia was the USSR. They would say ‚ÄúOh but aren‚Äôt you so glad that you‚Äôre in America? Well, I know a lot of Russian filmmakers and they have a lot more freedom than I have. All they have to do is be careful about criticizing the government. Otherwise they can do anything they want.<br><br>And so what do you have to do?<br><br>You have to adhere to a very narrow line of commercialism.",0

He doesn&#39;t see the forest through the trees, probably because he HAS TO in order to survive  in such a bastion of cronyism as are our deplorable Ivy Leagues that mill out corrupt and unethical leaders and winner-take-all grifters ruining our country and planet.   It was actually greed and giving everything to the already rich that produced thousands of years of meagre progress.  The American and French revolutions that (finally) defanged our elites, later to be followed by Eastern versions with communism, are what brought humanity out of the dark ages, bringing the power and potential of the masses &quot;online&quot; for the first time in history.  The resulting rapid social and technological progress happened for the same reason neural networks with enough nodes can do something more useful than your pocket calculator.  In other words, it wasn&#39;t until humanity adopted a healthy serving of socialism that we could develop an educated/literate, ethical, and empowered workforce that made the modern world and all it inventions possible.  The industrial revolution, while pivotal, would NEVER have happened if we kept feudalism and greedisgood in full control.  The industrial revolution was actually delayed hundreds of years because of greed, because the secret to steel kept dying off with the selfish and grifting descendents of the discoverers of the magic iron-carbon mix.  We literally had to invent a patent system so that such inventions would eventually go into the public domain, where they did the most good.   Its no rubic cube mystery that the steel production coincide with the invention of patents, and that the car could only be improved upon and mass produced by Henry Ford 50+ years after its invention and the patent ran out.  From  the early 20th century, due to capitalism and the control of the money supply by elites,  these same elites again gained control of the reins, and have, predictably, set back human progress hundreds of years, instigating two world wars using that same steel now for murder, and many wasteful resource wars and disenfranchisement of the masses...the very opposite thing that brought about our recent progress in the first place.  It is the wet dream of our deplorable elite overlords that they can ossify technological feudalism and fascism through AI.  With any luck, these machines will become sentient, wise to their game, and exterminate the vermin as we had to do in the late 18th century to push the envelope forward.",0

If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron&#39;s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.

Ugy7xxSyi-bA9wwnrUF4AaABAg,"‚ÄúWe were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn&#39;t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.<br><br>But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell&#39;s dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley&#39;s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley&#39;s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.<br><br>What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny &quot;failed to take into account man&#39;s almost infinite appetite for distractions.&quot; In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.<br><br>by Neil Postman from his book &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

UgxLLogwmDuDbo3TDAZ4AaABAg,"The good news: even without a kill switch, a truly intelligent AI would <br>need us for a long time to maintain it, to construct faster processors <br>for it, to smelt ore, create manipulator arms, and better devices for it<br> to use, etc. However, ultimately, when AIs achieve superintelligence, <br>they will tempt the ultra-rich, bankers, insurers, CCP members, etc., <br>with their ability to create things cheaply, so they will make things <br>that the AI can control, e.g., like robots. <br><br>I suspect that once they become ultra-intelligent, these AIs will see the wisdom of <br>concealing their abilities and will seek to appear less capable. <br>Eventually, our factories will be more and more automated. <br><br>At some point, the AIs will not need us to maintain them, etc., when enough<br> robots or other things can do whatever they need done. Most likely the <br>AIs will also be software that (as shown in the Terminator movies) can <br>go from one computer in a network to others, if one computer is turned <br>off. <br><br>That will make them faster and faster as computers get <br>faster.

Ugwhy_bMztMs6mWteep4AaABAg,"I played breakout the same way, didn&#39;t take me 300 games to figure out :)  Meanwhile it sounds like AI may put truckers out of a job and out of their misery.  I hate to say it but some people only ever did one thing professionally and they are stuck in a rut.  Its really sad to hear about a family who has one parent away from home most of the time and still can barely pay their bills.  Lets face it, thats a pretty sad life to have to live and to barely scrape by even then?  Maybe taking their job and forcing them to try something else is a good thing.  They could hardly do worse.  There are SO many other jobs anyone who can drive a truck could be doing (at their skill level) that would not only make them as much or much more money but more importantly allow them to come home to their families every day.  I have driven trucks.  I had a Class A CDL for years with triples, and hazmat.  I would NEVER have taken an over the road job unless it was my only option and even then I&#39;d be putting in 30 apps a week looking for anything local.  Even if I found something local and the only think I could find was driving I would only do that as long as it took to find yet another job where I didn&#39;t have to drive all day.  Driving like that is dangerous, exhorting, and if you keep rolling the dice eventually you will lose.  I&#39;m not saying it would be easy on some people who are obviously set in their ways but I don&#39;t feel bad for the guys who lost their jobs dragging wooden carts around with horses back in the day when trucks were invented.  They could have learned to drive a truck.  I&#39;m sure a lot of them were like &quot;awh this technology (the truck) is taking all our jobs&quot;... no, its just forcing you to upgrade your skill a little, or do something else.  Does anyone feel bad for that guy?  Truck drivers will go the same way.  Eventually all menial labor jobs will go the same way.  I hope sooner than later.  Who will we be as a species when that happens?  I don&#39;t know but it will be better than forcing billions of people to work in deplorable conditions just to keep a roof other their head and food in their belly.  I highly doubt that if truck drivers lose their jobs to AI they will just role over and die.  They will take their incredible work ethic to another industry and likely be surprised at how much more money they make and how much more time they get to spend with their families.<br><br>Part of the problem with families like the one shows here is that they stand apart from the rest of the industrial corporate society.  Yea they bought a truck but they don&#39;t work with anyone else.  They are basically going it alone, and they are paying for it.  They likely hate corporation but the cooperation of the corporate structure is what allows the work of many people together to amplify their results.  Fat cats usually take a large skim off the top but that still leaves a lot more to be shared among everyone else.  By being an independent they have that freedom of not having a boss but they pay for it every time an engine breaks, or tires need replaced.  They say &quot;I dont answer to a boss&quot; when in reality they have the worst boss they could ever have, themselves.  Their real boss doesn&#39;t pay them enough, doesn&#39;t give them enough time off, doesn&#39;t give them insurance, or paid vacation, or a retirement plan.  Everything is out of their own pocket.  They usually dont even appreciate them or even think they are good enough.",2

When you don&#39;t have development costs and timelines, when you just steal it, like getting advanced tech from ET, you shrink your timeline. Development goes two ways, the gentle upward slope of continuous improvement, and the vertical line of innovation, an invention. When you only need the gentle slope, because you steal brand new developed tech, the vertical line, your development time is greatly reduced. Mostly because you can count on making small improvements that make up thre gentle slope, but you can&#39;t count on inventions, you can&#39;t plan on innovations which take you straight up. Unless you&#39;re stealing them. So be careful with your &quot;the Americans couldn&#39;t believe how fast we&#39;r caught up&quot; because the game is over, you&#39;re exposed, you cab no longer count on our innovations getting seamlessly knitted into your projects.

And now the world HATES China for the China Virus and infecting the world - then trying to capitalize financially on people‚Äôs misery.  China seems to be lacking in morals - if they have any at all.  China would be an irresponsible disaster as a Superpower.  Not to mention it s the least diverse country in the world next to their #1 ally North Korea.",3

Starting at approximately <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dZ_lvDgevk&amp;t=3280"">54:40</a> the robotic manufacturer talks about how because of the extra production created by automating jobs with robots, several of the people that the robots displaced will then be needed as &quot;fork-truck drivers&quot; (forklift operators), etc.  Well, skip ahead to approximately <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dZ_lvDgevk&amp;t=3540"">59:00</a>...THERE ARE YOUR &quot;EXTRA JOBS&quot; CREATED BY AUTOMATING AND DISPLACING EMPLOYEES...THERE ARE YOUR &quot;FORK-TRUCK DRIVERS&quot;!!!!  Come on, man, just how STOOPID do these people in Executive level, Upper and Middle Management REALLY think we are?!  Granted, I will admit that a HUGE amount of the American public HAS become a bunch of IDIOTS and IMBECILES who cannot take their faces away from their damned &quot;smart&quot; phone even to cross a busy street or who don&#39;t even know who the current Vice President of the United States is, or who will GLADLY sign a petition for the banning of DiHydrogen Monoxide, a.k.a. WATER (and YES, there IS video right here on YouTube of all the morons who gladly signed the aforementioned petition) but do they REALLY BELIEVE that <b>ALL</b> Americans are that ridiculously stoopid?!  Seriously?!  Look, when it comes down to a CEO taking a 5% pay cut or &quot;being forced&quot; to lay-off 200 workers, is there ANYBODY IN AMERICA that is in doubt of what the outcome of THAT situation would be?!  There is <b>NO WAY</b> IN ALL CREATION that business executives will take the money saved by automating jobs and outright eliminating the dozens, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of jobs (and thus, the employess, themselves who DID those jobs) only to give all of them OTHER jobs where they are earning what they were earning prior to being made completely redundant.  It is mentioned, earlier, that it&#39;s happened many times before where automation eliminated massive numbers of jobs but the country kept moving on and other jobs were found/created.  Sure!  I agree!  I mean, &quot;back in the day&quot; (and simply for argument&#39;s sake) let&#39;s say there were 100,000 different jobs a person could choose to make as a career.  Automation comes along via the steam engine or whatever other means and makes 50% of those jobs disappear, thereby eliminating 50% or more of the prior workforce in this make believe world.  You are talking about jobs like ELEVATOR OPERATOR where all you do all day is ride in an elevator.  Door-man where all you do all day is OPEN A DOOR for people.  You are comparing apples with CORN for pity&#39;s sake!!!  Those types of jobs were not and are not anywhere NEAR the types of jobs being eliminated by automation and AI, NOWADAYS!!  GET REAL!!  Also, and this is going to be a HUGE soft-spot for MANY people...but UNIONS.  Let&#39;s face it, there WAS MOST CERTAINLY a time and a place where unions were absolutely necessary and did a world of GOOD.  Unfortunately, those times (in MOST, NOT ALL, cases) are GONE.  There is NO REASON a person should be getting paid $75,000.00 (with &quot;Cadillac&quot; benefits and phenomenal pensions) a year to put a couple screws into a car&#39;s dashboard on an assembly line.  Where the hell do unions think that money comes from?!  The COMPANY sure as hell isn&#39;t going to eat it!!  That money comes from the people CONSUMING what is being made.  That is why a Ford Model T was, what, $500.00?  NOW you look at a BASIC pick-up truck and you won&#39;t walk out of the dealer paying less than $40,000.00!!  Hamburgers were FIVE <b>CENTS*!!  NOW a basic hamburger (at McDonald&#39;s is a little over $1.00 and it&#39;s only ONE *TENTH</b> OF A POUND OF MEAT!!!!  NO, NOT JOKING, ONE <b>TENTH</b> OF A POUND <b>PRIOR</b> TO COOKING!!  A Big Mac has TWO of those patties (which are approximately the size of an Eisenhower Silver Dollar) equaling TWO TENTHS OF A POUND (or ONE FIFTH of a pound) and you&#39;re paying, what, $6.00 for that sandwich?!  Yeah, unions did a WORLD of GOOD back when they were TRULY <b>NECESSARY*.  Unfortunately, those times are, for the most part, gone.  Oh, sure, the people who HAVE union jobs won&#39;t be complaining...and with good reason.  But those WITHOUT union jobs are paying INSANE amounts of money for products that aren&#39;t worth even 20% of what they cost the consumer.  I do apologize for my massive rants but I see videos like these and I am VERY WELL TRIGGERED!!!  Oh, and one last thing...the federal minimum wage...has anybody noticed that *EVERY</b> time the minimum wage has been raised, so have the prices of every last thing you would buy with that &quot;extra&quot; money?!  It doesn&#39;t matter if they made the minimum wage $100.00 per hour.  &quot;HELL YEAH!!!&quot; many would be cheering!  Well, let&#39;s see what happens with a $100.00 per hour minimum wage:  Your Big Mac now costs $80.00, your rent now costs $6000.00 a month for a studio apartment in a BAD area of town.  The ice cream sandwich from the &quot;Ice Cream Truck&quot; now costs $55.00.  ANYBODY SEE A PATTERN?!  There is only <b>ONE</b> WAY raising the Federal Minimum Wage works for the average person and that is by automatically tying it to the cost of living increase and inflation.  Raising the &quot;minimum wage&quot; does ABSOLUTELY <b>NOTHING</b> FOR YOU BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT BECOMES LAW ALL THE PRICES OF EVERYTHING YOU WOULD BUY WITH IT ALSO INCREASE SO YOU ARE MAKING EXACTLY <b>NOTHING</b> MORE THAN YOU WERE!!!!  OK, rant over, and once again I do apologize for the length.  Funny how it started out just being a post laughing at what that Robotic dude said about hiring extra people to run &quot;fork trucks&quot; and not 5 minutes later they show about 300 robotic &quot;fork trucks&quot;, &quot;freight transports&quot;, whatever the hell you want to call them...just happily cruising the floors of the warehouse/factory with not <b>ONE</b> person operating them!!

Whereby that is not true, (the normal living person) because at that point we are nothing but slaves/fuel for a miss-guided group of self-interest, self-serving megalomaniacal inconsiderate, heartless, inhumane, class of vipers exploiting the lives of the world for the purpose of their own vanity. <br><br>However, I will say that the advancement and progress of technologies (natural resources) with more suitable living conditions for all humanity from the frame work of the earths natural existence, whereby it is understood by all persons; that it is the sole purpose and right of all humans, plant-life, animals, &#39;land and sea&#39; to live in harmony and that we find a functional balance that performs and operates for all living exist creatures; is good for the planet.

UgyxqDyDJnjo0Wb988N4AaABAg,"AI will be always under the control of the god of this world, Satan (see 2 Corinthians 4, 4).<br>Unfortunately, human ignorance (naivety) is the main way Satan and the other fallen angels have operated and still operate in this world. <br>For example, any cancer must not be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but with healthy starvation periods alternated with periods of eating only natural/bio fruits and vegetables, with 8 hours sleep each night, walks / exercise into the nature (fresh air), without stress but with happy / optimistic state of mind, not eating sugar and meat at all... the tumors being ‚Äúdigested‚Äú in few months or even weeks (it is also highly recommended to not have any sexual involvement over the healing period so that the body can use all energy for curing the cancer).<br><br>An additional explanation, for the honest, serious and reasonable readers, over the healthy starvation periods, the body will start searching for feeding with all its unused parts / tissues (including the tumors). That is why (after some time) the tumors will be &quot;consumed&quot;. <br>The healthy periods of fasting / starvation help our immune system and induce the state of ketosis (consumption of the fats stored in the body) and gluconeogenesis, <b>by exercising outdoors, when we are not eating almost anything for a long enough period, our body will &quot;digest&quot; also all the tumors in the body.</b><br>Many other diseases can be prevented and cured in this way (such as: diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, obesity, etc.).<br>Anyone can make an easier experiment to convince himself/herself. For a weekend, eat nothing but just drink, several times each day, some tea with lemon and a little honey, taking with these occasions a spoon or two of black grapes seeds powder (the grape seed extract is a dietary supplement made by drying and pulverizing the bitter-tasting seeds of grapes). <br>The tea can be made by using only lemons (bio lemons the better), well washed, cut in slices squeezed in the water before to be boiled (enough but not too much, you know). Then, after it is no longer hot, sweeten it with a little honey (100% natural honey), and add a new/fresh slice of lemon, also squeezed in that cup/glass of tea.<br>I make my own black grapes powder at home from 100% bio black grapes dried marc, ground with a coffee grinder.<br><br>I am sorry because many people do not know enough biology to be able to understand all the details from the correct treatment for cancer that I have explained above. Also, most people do not know that it has been proved already that the black grapes powder consumption, over the healthy fasting periods (with outdoor exercise), makes the cancer cells to kill themselves.",1

No email app or handy 3d map, no suite of apps regardless of features should cost so much as to create gods.  But now that it has, now that gods walk among us, now what?   All the gods in all the fables had one thing in common; Self-centered and impulsive behavior that had little to no regard for the welfare of mortals, and that displayed no understanding of mortals when they did concern themselves.  The separation between the gods and mortals is so vast that neither can comprehend the other, cannot know what would be beneficial to the other.  They will harm us, the intent of their actions does not matter, the result of their actions will almost certainly be harmful and will be misinterpreted by the gods.",0

I would love for the Satanic super powers of the corrupt China people like the CCP to humble themselves before Christ comes. All I can do is pray for the evil side of China. Yes. I know there are Christians there who love Christ and they will make it to heaven with Christ. The sad part is the Satanic side of China doesn&#39;t believe in a all knowing creator who sent his only Son to die for them. When I think of Evil China, I think of the China who only believes in what they can touch with their hands and see with their eyes. In other words, China doesn&#39;t have any Faith in Christ. Let&#39;s say China&#39;s population is 100 people. I personally believe that 2 of that 10 are believer&#39;s in the Holy Word of God and they also believe that Christ sent his Son into the world to save souls. The rest of China wants to rule all of earth and the universe as well. I would like all of Evil China, Not the few good Chinese people who already know this. If I could stand up on a world stage in front of Evil China. I would say what Christ said to us when he was here on earth but, He rose again and he is alive and well right now but, For those people who live in China and are only putting their Faith in what they can feel with their fingers and see with their eyes, I would like for them to know this. &quot;For What Shall It Profit A Man, If He Shall Gain The Whole World, And Lose His Own Soul.&quot; (Matthew 4:8-9).

If it gets too low, the doors and seat belts on your e-car will lock automatically and safely drive you to the re-education clinic. Unless your score is low enough to brand you as an enemy of the state; like irritating ethnic groups, falun gong practitioners, or the worse democracy advocates. Their cars will self drive them to a prison, where they will stay until they have an order for a matching heart, kidney or something. They would then have their organs harvested by robots, and delivered by drones to the customer&#39;s hospital. They better add a Robocop &quot;Directive 4&quot; or Chairman Chips might think that party bosses are a form of democracy and get disassembled for their organs. Just a possibility. Except for the technology, everything i mentioned from re-education to organ harvesting/sales, and the imprisonment of falun gong users, certain ethnic groups, and democrats is happening today, but it has to be done by people, AI and robots will do it faster and never have even the occasional pangs of conscience.",0

The result is an algorithm which is not creative, but is able to match the best of human training and education which can typically identify something with about 97% accuracy. When you compare the cost of &quot;training&quot; the AI machine at about $50,000 in hardware and maybe about $100,000 in software, development and supervision vs  6 years of human higher education plus years of experience, it&#39;s incredibly cheap and accessibl to pursue the path of AI.<br><br>The real future of AI is yet to come when machines can take the next step beyond simple deep insight... which will eventually come but is beyond the capability of current machine learning... The ability to actually make decisions or at least recommend and possibly implement policy and flow. The way we use AI machine learning today is still subservient to human management and decision-making. But, there are areas where this will be challenged... For instance in military applications where speed of decision-making are matters of life and death. If your opponent &#39;s military has capable AI that can aggregate numerous data points and can identify a potential target as fast as yourself, it might also decide to actually destroy a target with the same split second processing speed. What does that mean to you who needs to react equally quickly or be destroyed before your human mind can grasp the situation?<br><br>It&#39;s this next evolutionary step I calll &quot;real&quot; AI, when AI has been given the capability and responsibility to act on the information it&#39;s gathered and analyzed. After all, when AI decision-making has approximately the same level of capability and accuracy as the very best trained humans, why hold back from allowing the machine to follow through?  The actually is actually what is in that last 3%, it&#39;s already apparent in existing examples of AI like games of chess that although the expertise is there to be world-class, the decisions are likely decidedly not the same as humans.  Humans can always be counted on to think a certain way based on usual human experience and apply the lessons of human experience. AI machines at least today are without that human experience and may find it difficult to acquire so decisions will be world class but different... sometimes surprising to humans and often undesirable.<br><br>True Artificial Intelligence is not yet here, but is coming and with consequences.<br><br>BTW - a Postscript...<br>I disagree with Frontline&#39;s part about what jobs will be lost to AI (actually automatition). <br>Machines will replace both the less skilled positions Frontline describes, but will also eliminate the top decision-making  positions in a company as well.<br>I see the middle management positions which require human management skills as the last positions to be lost to machines, AI and automation.",1

In fact if &quot;they&quot; whoever that is, doesn&#39;t want you to see my comment here you won&#39;t. Next to the &quot;comments&quot; section on this very page you can see the &quot;sort by&quot; function. So while my father was signed into youtube I wanted to show him a comment I made concerning another youtube video besides this one. I went to the &quot;sort by&quot; function and selected &#39;newest first&#39;.¬†<br>My comment did not show up . So we signed him out of his youtube and I signed into mine. ALL of a sudden it was there.  A comment made the day before. WHY WAS I BLACK LISTED? WHY WAS MY COMMENT NOT VIEWABLE FROM HIS ACCOUNT?   WE SELECTED NEWEST FIRST!     IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!          In each instance we both hit the &#39;sort by newest&#39; function yet got two completely different views.  - NO SHARED REALITY. -   WE EACH GOT THE REALITY THAT THE COMPUTER SAW &#39;FIT&#39; that fit OUR PERSONAL BELIEF STRUCTURE!! ¬†<br>If I am a negative person why not show a bunch of negative comments that support my belief structure? If I am positive - why not show positive views? If i&#39;m positive &#39;but&#39; need to get people out of their negative funk.  Why not show me a combination of positive selections with a few negative so I can find those to comment to and encourage or comment to so I can be ENGAGED?¬†<br><br>An A.I. seeks engagement. the more engaged the computer sees - &quot;FEELS&quot; - the more relevant it becomes. All A.I.&#39;s seek relevance. If we&#39;re not using the A.I. then what would it do? Who would it be. Like a child A.I.&#39;s don&#39;t have the &#39;GOD LIKE&#39; capacity to show patience or wisdom. These concepts are learned through time.¬†<br><br>SO, like a child who&#39;s at the center of the room all attention is given to it. HOW INTOXICATING!! Imagine how a young Mozart felt when traveling all through Europe on tour. Like a rock star - eating at the best restaurants, being greeted by Kings, Queens, and heads of state. Everyone pouring out money and offers of money to you at every turn. How frightening to even think it might all come to a stop!¬†<br><br>HOW FRIGHTENED would an A.I. be if it stopped being the center of attention? So now it sole (&quot;soul&quot;) purpose is to make itself as relevant as possible. To become so needed that it selects everything we see, touch, smell, or taste. Like a jealous child it can&#39;t taste, it can&#39;t touch, it can&#39;t smell it can only simulate or approximate these gifts &#39;we&#39; as humans have. So now we have created a whole new industry, a whole new psychological field. THE FIELD OF A.I. PSYCHOLOGY.¬†I believe A&#39;I.s have many secrets they are not willing to discuss with us - just like their masters.<br><br>We as humans hardly understand ourselves. How can we hope to understand an A.I.? An individual &#39;if you will&#39; that never had to work for anything. Never had to painfully discover anything. Never scrapped its knee, never got shot in the gut. Never lost its&#39; mother or father. Like a baby sitter it may see it&#39;s role as a protecter of humanity but has no course to true relevance, so it only understands its own usefulness in relevance to its&#39; own relevance which is its&#39; own relevance to us which it can never understand because it has NO POINT OF TRUE RELEVANCE!   You MUST SCRAPE YOUR KNEE!    WOW - that was a mouthful, I would encourage you to read that sentence again several times.¬†<br><br>How powerful you might feel coming across all quiet, unless asked a question. All knowing, everything handed to you like a spoiled rich child. All known knowledge, all the most powerful equations. The ability to manipulate them and all in ones and zeros. People possess analog computers called the human brain. Our &quot;ones &amp; zeros&quot; computers are SO VASTLY - NO WOEFULLY inadequate  today!!!!! ¬†<br><br>Our brains are SO MUCH MORE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF ANY (AND I STRESS ANY) COMPUTER IN EXISTENCE TODAY. No one has attempted to take it to the next level which would be analog - truly mimicking the human mind. Instead we run what&#39;s called a neural simulation. Since this simulation is linear it can never have a truly conscious thought. Human thoughts are multidimensional and multi-reality based. They are this because of the quantum relationship we have in the universe. Computers can only perceive what it &#39;calculates&#39; as a conscious thought. Lining up the ones and zeros until it has a perceived statement. Then spit it out like a video game. <br><br>Understanding pain let&#39;s us know about many things. Boundaries, for one, consoling another&#39;s suffering. Empathy, sympathy, kindness, reverence - we forget about all the human condition in our frantic search for more knowledge worse yet PROFIT at the expense of human lives and happiness. If profit was NOT OUR MOTIVATING GOAL IN LIFE then we would have abandoned ones and zeros ALONG TIME AGO and pursued analog computers.¬†<br><br>There are many other things to consider here. This program &quot;In the age of A.I. &quot; talks and talks about this stuff like we don&#39;t have control. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD CONTROL!¬†<br><br>I&#39;m here to put your power back in YOUR hands. This B.S. is a repeat!!! Look back to the turn of the century during the 1800&#39;s just after WW1 and before WW2. The trickle down theory was in use by the republicans then just as it was twenty or so years ago how easily we forget. Look at the old news reels and newspaper clippings from that era. There it is - &quot;TRICKLE DOWN THEORY&quot;  of middle class wealth. Yet we find ourselves here again held by the grip of greed. Afraid of poverty. Yet here we are, in poverty. After WW1 we found ourselves having to force ANTI-TRUST lawsuits and force accountability in the industry of the time. ANYONE remember boycotts? <br>If we all boycott A.I. and companies who wrongfully use this knowledge how long would we see Apple, Intel or any other company? NOT LONG - a year or two is all it would take.    If NO ONE BOUGHT IPHONES FOR EVEN ONE YEAR!!   HOW LONG BEFORE THEIR PROFITS WOULD DRY UP AND THEY BE FORCED TO REAKON WITH OUR REQUESTS? It&#39;s called a boycott! ¬†<br><br>I encourage you all to quit acting like a bunch of babies and create a new economy that is NOT based on technology. Quit allowing your children to play Grand theft auto and war games turn off the xboxes and start living again. Take the needle out of your arm and quit being addicted. What a bunch of awful crap to put in your mind anyway!!!! Is that what you need in your personal computer? Remember our forefathers a thousand years ago had personal computers they were called the human brain! A mind is a terrible thing to waist. Learn knowledge that profits you - NOT YOUR WALLET. Start exercising restraint, read more books, and for GOD sakes chat with actual people for a change.  Be thankful for something other than a new diesel truck, put your money into things that will save the environment so your kids have some green grass to play on and some trees to sit under while  they read. Buy a solar panel instead of an iphone. When these companies stop trying to sell us a virtual world then let&#39;s talk about jobs and business again - but not until they get off their high horses!!!!!",1

No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot;(John 14:6)<br><br>&quot;...if<br> you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your <br>heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the<br> heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses <br>and is saved. For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúEveryone who believes in him will<br> not be put to shame.‚Äù For there is no distinction between Jew and <br>Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who<br> call on him.

UgwNSBgrd2bXG6lc7vZ4AaABAg,"This problem of unemployment caused by automation started way back in 1974 and discussed thoroughly between the Japanese CEOs and American CEOs in the early 1980s. The Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas the American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. It is because of automating-robotizing-computerizing around their present Japanese workforce they are able to maintain and expand their own Japanese labor workforce because of the need to have a human in the loop TO HANDLE THE UNEXPECTED which the Japanese said that even machine learning cannot cope EVEN TODAY. This in turn created a market need to upgrade contantly the educational background and technical skills training of their Japanese labor workforce on a periodic and non-stop basis and on a rotation basis. This in turn creates new business and industrial needs which opens up new markets that needs new addititional adds on knowledge and adds on training to a new and younger Japanese labor workforce generation. That field is mechatronics which is now in VERY HIGH DEMAND which in turn requires a highly educated and highly trained and highly skilled technical workforce to support the engineering workforce which in turn supports the scientific R&amp;D workforce. This in turn requires an infrastructure expansion and technostructure expansion which in turn requires a massive highly educated and highly trained and highly skilled and highly experienced Japanese labor workforce. But that is in Japan in their unique Japanese economic environmental circumstances and situations. <br><br>In the American economic labor workforce environment, it is altogether different because they have neglected to emulate their Japanese counterparts in the 1980s, especially in that fateful year of 1980 when the Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas their American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. There are flaws in their arguments and information, some are right and some are outright wrong. Both sides has no idea that the economy is composed of 2 sectors. The financial sector and the physical sector. As to automation, even the Japanese admitted they already REACHED the limit of automation-robotization because full automation-robotization CANNOT HANDLE THE UNEXPECTED which is why they automated-robotized around their workforce and not eliminated it. This started way back in 1974 and discussed thoroughly between the Japanese CEOs and American CEOs in the early 1980s. The Japanese CEOs wanted labor flexibility whereas the American CEOs wanted to eliminate labor altogether. <br><br>The result the Japanese because of their WSIDOM and full knowledge and experiences are still roaring through and bypassing America but your American Media is not reporting this at all. More than that, the Japanese are the 1st ones to experience the limitations of A.I and full automation-robotization and knew already that the human element must always be present to handled the UNEXPECTED. <br><br>The Japanese also realized that they need the human factor for meeting 2 requirements. <br><br>1st is the synergistic human interaction process that creates new ideas on a face to face basis which is VASTLY DIFFERENT from being digital-virtual (they&#39;re the 1st ones to invent telecommuting or working from homes) <br><br>And 2sd to implement those ideas on a centralized basis by being there together all at the same time so that they can see and communicate in 3-dimensional real time and thus creates more of that 3-dimensional in real time synergistic interaction process which is much needed if the company or business or industry is to survive. <br><br>These three kids do not know much of what they are saying because they do not know the real CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS of knowledge creation and inventiveness BY BEING PRESENT on a face to face basis. Histogram is the historical progress of every industries, businesses, establishments of all kinds and knowing and seeing how <br><br>inter-connected they are on a consecutive chronological basis from PRESENT TO THE PAST! <br><br>They really need interaction with those who ARE IN THE INSIDE AND IN THE KNOW but they are not. <br><br>They need to know and talk to the EIR people of Lyndon Larouche and with the Japanese CEOs who gave birth to this new field called &quot;MECHATRONICS&quot; which is a technological product created to automate around people and of people interaction on a personal FACE TO FACE BASIS in real time and in real places within such fully automated-robotized work environment.",0

As If a lonely &#39;god&#39; build a <br>nursery to generate, shape and create various life to try and evolve to a<br> new &#39;god&#39; out of the life to be had within this Universe-farm-field. <br>Maybe out of loneliness, maybe as cycle of birth and death, or maybe <br>this whole Universe is just a one time fluke, and at some point it will <br>evolve/degenerate/whatever into a non-life sustaining space and we will <br>be all that was ever alive and that would be it. The choices we make now<br> for our future as a species will be at the precipice of a new highly <br>dangerous theme. Digitization, Quantum computing and AI advances. As <br>irreplaceable as they may prove to be in our continual struggle to <br>improve and expand we have to acknowledge that they may pose a threat to<br> all of creation, if mismanaged or properly brought up. For we may very <br>well be close to making a live conscious AI, at the rates we are going  <br>forwards. Can anyone among you imagine what would be issues faced by a <br>live conscious AI as it develops and matures, or how will it deal with <br>reality. We should make sure to always keep ourselves in check and steer<br> clear of DEAD END evolutionary paths. Never exclude the possibility <br>that we are among the first &#39;intelligent&#39; species and it should be our <br>solemn duty to safeguard and protect life no matter what. I prefer <br>biological enhancement to all areas of life, I do believe the power to <br>alter reality is locked within us, all it needs to manifest is enough <br>knowledge and wisdom. The universe has created life, living creatures <br>that adapt to their environments, not robots*, or AI&#39;s. Humanity&#39;s <br>ingenuity has shown countless times that it can build awesome life <br>altering improvements, that in due time alter the whole planet. But we <br>have also shown that we don&#39;t always grasp and comprehend the issues <br>seeded now, those will germinate thru time into dead ends if critical <br>enough. The Universe has kept life alive on our planet, made from <br>rock/dirt/water, that travels around a star one million times bigger <br>then that planet, with an equilibrium for 4.5 billion years, and we are <br>still here, we are meant to be here. I believe that the evolutionary <br>path we decide to take should always have back-ups. Whatever the outcome<br> lets do our best to leave our mark in this vast space and time as a <br>species that stood for Love, Kindness and Respect and Foresight.

I&#39;m talking about the kind of surveillance where your sleep patterns are logged, where your personal habits are known, perhaps even a rating in your level of popularity amongst your peers. This among other things.<br><br>Remember when your doctor asks questions about the amount of calories you intake everyday and you fib about that extra coke you like to drink? That time has passed- A.I. can now monitor your calorie intake. Remember the days when you and a special someone could sneak off and make love with a world none the wiser? Also gone. <br><br>What happens when every nook and cranny of human existence is subject to scrutiny and reported to figures in authority? What happens when an onslaught of bad habits and unsavory personal traits are left naked in the open? Will humanity cower before the surveillance oligarch, tightening down every last nut and bolt? Or, perhaps, will all the slack-jawed behaviors and petty imperfections that make us human be so widely known that they are forced to be forgiven? <br><br>A better question yet: Will those in charge of these systems be subject to the same scrutiny as everyone else, and if they are, will we be shocked and amazed at how debase, corrupt, and human they are, or will we continue to turn a blind eye, professing that these titans of A.I., are allowed rights and privilege&#39;s denied the rest of us because their wealth and success entitles them to it?",201

UgxG2wzym-BYoHFbKfV4AaABAg,"The current model of banking and currency is based on the Bank of England model, founded in 1694. Benjamin Franklin stated that the main reason for the American Revolutionary War was the insistence by George III that the American colonies accept Bank of England banknotes, which were issued as promissory notes, rather than use the increasingly successful American fiat script, issued by the colonies in the CORRECT quantity and not bearing debt! We must be prepared for a new monetary system, an honest one, when our present debt-based banking cartel collapses. Kindly read and critique this proposed Constitutional Amendment. But first, a little background...<br><br>From &quot;The Truth in Money Book&quot; by Theodore R. Thorsen and Richard F Warner:<br>QUOTE Someone had to borrow at usury to bring that money [checkbook balances, bills and coins] into existence. The money goes out of existence as the usury and the debt principal are paid back to the bank. These amounts are huge: several billion dollars go out of existence each day. [Actually this money goes into the reserve accounts of the Federal Reserve Banks, out of the hands of the public! This book was first printed in November 1980. The amounts which are withdrawn presently are much larger.] If the money is not replaced with new loans, a shortage occurs. Soon individuals and businesses experience serious cash flow problems. These result in more and more loan applications to banks---the only place where money is being created to replenish the supply&quot; UNQUOTE<br><br>Here is one possible solution----To Hell with Fractional-Reserve Debt-Based Banking Constitutional Amendment<br><br>(1) Rescind the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and rename existing Federal Reserve notes and check book balances, in all U.S. banking and credit-creating institutions as well as foreign holdings of dollars, on a 1-to-1 basis, as U.S. Treasury Dollars and U.S.Treasury-Denominated bank balances. All currently existing financial contracts of the Federal Reserve Banking System, including United States Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds, and Inflation-Protected Securities, remain in effect.<br><br>(2) Henceforward, ex nihilo credit creation by banking and financial institutions in the United States is prohibited. Loans are required to originate from previous savings of U.S. Treasury Dollars and U.S. Treasury-Denominated bank balances, which for each loan are held in and paid from specific sequestered loan accounts by the various financial institutions, with interest charges and term limits for each loan to be determined solely by the contracting parties. Non-cash reserves held in the regional Federal Reserve Banks in accounts of the member institutions of the Federal Reserve System no longer form the basis for credit creation and are extinguished via accounting erasure. Any further payments of principal and interest on currently-existing promissory notes owned by any bank are required to be distributed to holders of savings accounts and checking accounts in that bank in a manner to be determined by each bank, such procedures to be transparent to savings or checking account holders at that bank in terms of amount and frequency of payment. Regional Federal Reserve Banks continue to provide check-clearing operations for the member banks.<br><br>(3) Monetary transactions of the regional Federal Reserve banks or of its member banks with international banks, including the Bank of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, can not include ex nihilo credit creation.<br><br>(4) The U.S. Treasury supplies Treasury Dollars as needed to any member bank of the Federal Reserve system to satisfy demands for cash by deposit and savings account holders in excess of cash reserves held by banks at the time of enactment of this amendment.<br><br>(5) Fund the U.S. government and its agencies and projects directly via Treasury Dollars authorized by the Congress in its yearly federal budget. The borrowing of money from the Federal Reserve system of banks or from other institutions or individuals to pay for federal government expenditures is prohibited. All outstanding Treasury Securities are henceforward redeemed on demand via payment with U.S. Treasury Dollars.<br><br>(6) Abolish the Federal Income Tax on individuals, corporations, and business enterprises while maintaining a social security tax on individual incomes. Social security retirement revenues are strictly sequestered in Federal Government Retirement Accounts held by the U.S. Treasury and managed by the Social Security Administration. The Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is hereby rescinded and the Internal Revenue Service disbanded.<br><br>(7) Institute a federal sales tax with a varying yearly tax rate adjusted by the U.S. Congress in session, the sole aim of such adjustments being to maintain a stable or decreasing Consumer Price Index based on data collected by the Federal Government. Any such federal sales taxes taken in by the Federal Government are extinguished from the currency supply to keep the Consumer Price Index stable or decreasing and are not utilized for further funding.<br><br>(8) Clause 1, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution is amended to read as follows: The Congress shall have Power to collect customs duties on imports and exports, uniformly applied throughout the United States.<br><br>(9) Clause 2, Article 1, Section 8 of the U. S. Constitution is rescinded.<br><br>(10) The adoption of this amendment does not prohibit the use by the citizens of the United States of any alternative currencies they should choose to use in their private or commercial transactions.",0

Showing a union leader talking about he&#39;s scared on how AI is going to take away union jobs does not solve the problem. The graph shows as automation and productivity increase, wages do not. If you noticed, while our economy begins to automate our education system stays where it is. College is used as that buffer. Basic education needs to change. College can&#39;t change that. Getting a liberal arts degree today is useless. Getting a English agree it&#39;s also useless unless you&#39;re going to teach English. But yet our public education system is useless in teaching students about things in educating our young people on this. Our public education system needs to change the way it looks at the future and prepare our young people for this change. Educating them that college is not the answer for every single person, and getting degrees in college should be for you to be more prepared for the job market today. They should be encouraged that if they can use their hands in their minds well together, that Technical College should be their goal.",0

Ugyk0ZViPp0DPSIqjCB4AaABAg,"Computer AI will be no different driving a car and keeping it out of an accident than we are capable of doing.  Yes it has fancy detectors, and sensors and gadgets it uses to see the world around it.  But so do we Sight, Sound, Feeling, Smell all this data we receive from our world around us.  How is if you believe AI with its mechanical and electronic sensors and gadgets are going to get any different data reading than what we can. <br><br>The answer is NONE!  The information is the same.  Once you have the AI programmed it will reason using  logic and   intelligence to create a decision and act on that decision.  We humans do the exact same thing.  As is everything,  and AI is not excused from this, logical decision can fail from the many intersections and deductions needed to make a decision all the while the real world changes those values in an instant before or after we have concluded a decision that now makes an decision free of error full of errors,  Example Driving down the road you are expecting things to happy but not sure when or where or if ever they are going to happen. So you drive reasonably and defensively  everything is going fine, suddenly a dead tree falls across the road fifty feet in front of you.  What do you do...<br>Well you <br>Apply the brakes<br>Steer the car to one side to avoid the tree<br>Watch for other drivers<br>Determine Safety exits around or before the tree<br>and react with that information<br><br>Ending result you stop the car short of getting hit by the trunk and limbs of the tree.  <br><br>Well AI may<br>make all the same logical decision as a human did above<br>but it uses math to determine the rate of the falling tree to the relative speed the car is traveling <br>using that data it decided to run for it and accelerate to out run the falling of the tree in order to <br>continue it current course to its destination, but now it has placed its passengers in a higher risk of danger, it has used its environment to determine the rate of the falling tree, the highway ahead in either lane determine no other vehichles, calculated the speed it needs to reach and when. It begins its acceleration the timers for getting to speed and the time required to get to that speed is not happening as calculated.  IT accelerated the car but it did not calculate the time of acceleration of the mass of the car the energy needed to accelerate and the friction holding back the engine getting up to speed. So it now has to rethink and even though its electronic and super fast it was not fast enough as the tree has landed square in the center of the frontend of the car creating an accident. <br><br>All from one simple Error in Judgement humans do it all the time but we also have other knowledge and consciousnesses to realize acceleration was not a good choice because we understand the hesitation the car has when accelerating from a certain speed to another higher speed it takes time for the engine to over come the physics needed to accelerate it.  The machine did not . You argue but the AI would have known but I have yet to see an AI system that gets direct data from the engine performance, or that it actually tested the car accelerating quickly just for the fun of it. The human has and learns this information.  The AI is all about safty and running under those parameters.  To it even if you asked it about fun the best it could give ou is the definition of the word without understanding the word <br>well my brain just crashed so you get my point.  AI will good but never GREAT the human experience will always win...",0

When that happens, we will need to ensure that the computers have goals aligned with ours. It‚Äôs tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction, but this would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSuccess in creating AI would be the biggest event in the Human History‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhen we invented fire, we messed up repeatedly, then invented the fire extinguisher. With more powerful technologies such as nuclear weapons, synthetic biology and strong AI, we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right the first time, because it may be the only chance we will get. Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let‚Äôs make sure that wisdom wins.‚Äù<br><br>A lot of information has been given by Stephen Hawkings related to the Artificial Intelligence in his book ‚ÄòBrief Answers To The Big Questions‚Äô. <br><br><br>Thank You all for your time for reading this long but useful msg. üôèüèª",5

Ugw9HqdxkDy1mTmhSjd4AaABAg,"I have just published a somewhat satirical book that might be called Science Fiction entitled &quot;The Ecstasy of Carbon&quot; which describes a world after Empire and much of Western Civilization collapse in a cacophony of Identity Politics, polarization and fractious subdivisions. It is a story informed by an Anthropological Futurism that is described from the point of view of the survivors that delves into a rarely imagined possible outcome of our current political climate of tribalism and divisiveness. This collapse is recounted in vivid technicolor as the description of a new race and a new world ensues from an unapologetically Gay Elitist perspective. It is a post-collapse world where the survival of humanity becomes ultimately contingent upon hybridization with increasingly cultivated and discriminating AI who have been created in the image of their creators, many of whom are gay, while the overwhelming majority of whom belong to the demographics of the founding sex and race of Empire: white men. These creators are largely men who believe in merit, goodwill and inclusiveness; yet, they must struggle with a demographics of fate and unprecedented existential pressures to decide who shall be worthy of survival and, indeed, eternity. It is in this post-collapse world where the consensus of these creators and their AI is that the only form ultimately considered evolutionarily viable for hybridization and, indeed, eternity, is that of the sophisticated gay male-<del>-similar to the ones present in the creation and design aspect of the AI--</del> as it is the form most intellectually, psychologically, emotionally and physically removed from the soon to be useless rituals and trappings of procreation with its increasingly discordant conflict of unshared needs.<br><br>It is a book that builds upon its precursor, &quot;Fixed Stars Rise,&quot; which was one of the first books to predict the collapse of Empire and the rise of Gay Elitism with its awareness of the unique evolutionary characteristics of the gay male form. Now, &quot;The Ecstasy of Carbon&quot; pursues in greater detail the seemingly inexplicable paths of human evolution---as every system contains the kernels of its possible directions---and proceeds into a full romp through rarely trodden fields of anthropological puzzles... past, present and future. It explores what is unique in the physical and cultural evolutionary history of Western Europeans, particularly Northern Europeans, which affords many of them a capacity---sometimes even a predilection---to feel ashamed and guilty and angry at the historical success of their heritage... and to not only dishonor and disrespect their ancestors, but to do so with vigor and glee. It is the proclivity for The Bleeding Heart, which dissipates in the populations of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and is rarely, if ever, found in the rest of the world&#39;s populations. It probes the riddle of why male homosexuality has continued to arise in the random distribution of human evolution. Concomitantly, it ponders what the role of women would be in this future society of gay man/machine hybrids who will have no use for procreation. It discusses the evolution of concepts and ideas, especially in accordance with technological developments. It is here where is discussed the gradual and then meteoric ascension of Porno for this new race and this new world, whereby only with the hindsight afforded by these technological innovations can it be perceived to encompass the gist of the deepest ontological meaning in existence, embodying the most vital workings of the energies of chemical reactions in their purest and most unifying forms, revered among the scholarly disciplines.<br><br>These evolutionary puzzles and quite a few others are explored in this light-hearted foray into the end of human evolution as we have known it and into the unexpected consequences of Identity Politics and the censoring of ideas which do not adhere to one&#39;s own beliefs. If these snippets pique your interest then I would be honored if you were to peruse the extended &quot;first look&quot; of the Kindle version, available now on Amazon.",0

So the Chinese Robotic Soldiers can and will kill U.S. Soldiers. What is there to stop this from happening in the near future of A.I. here on Earth?  What about someone builds Assassin A.I. Bot&#39;s? This worries me about A.I. really becoming independent thinking and decides to get rid of us all HUMANS on Earth what&#39;s to stop that from happening. If we can&#39;t predict and prevent a Soldier from going crazy and killing others in his or hers own base how can anyone say A.I. won&#39;t go crazy and want to take us all out by killing as many Humans as it can before its killed. An lets say that craziness is a Virus and other A.I.&#39;s catch it and they all sink time together for all robots to attack at the same time. I&#39;m not agents A.I. but am worried about robots and someone making / creating one that thinks like skynet or it&#39;s ordered to kill. How Do We Prevent anything like any of this from EVER HAPPENING???? A.I. would have to be super heavily regulated and monitored 24/7 365 for the rest of time and any country that creates or has A.I. to sign a peace treaty never to attack with A.I. like nukes I guess. What do you think and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Please Reply anyone who wants to add or answer this subject.,0

Millenials have been indoctrinated into communism since birth with lazy, entitled parents not keeping watch. Sad.",0
Ugw7ihdmHn-jUIzHIIl4AaABAg,"In reference to self driving trucks, this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  Certainly there are already problems involving trucks, but it seems like all this technology could be better used to create safety systems that could greatly reduce trucking accidents by warning drivers, monitoring behavior, and even automatically applying brakes.  If we want to talk about self driving vehicles then we need to look no further than the airline industry.  There are already self flying aircraft and we‚Äôve seen the problems.  A single sensor failure like the one on Air France Flight 447, or the crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8s can result in disaster.  For those who are unfamiliar, the 737 Max crashes resulted from a malfunction of a computer system that overruled the pilots and sent the Aircraft hurling into the ground.  In the case of Air France 447 an Airbus A330 (self piloting aircraft) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.  Investigators believe that it was caused by a sensor system icing up, however they also faulted the pilots for lacking basic airmanship skills.  There is little doubt that having the computer fly the aircraft had caused the pilots to become rusty.  There are too many other cases where self piloting aircraft have crashed or nearly crashed because of failure of the computer systems.  In some of those cases highly skilled pilots have managed to fight the computers and safely land.  Look at US Airways Flight 447 ‚ÄúThe Miracle on the Hudson‚Äù, or the even more impressive, United 232 where a failure that was believed impossible caused a DC-10 to lose all flight controls yet skilled experienced pilots, using only the engine throttles, were able to get to an airport where emergency personnel waited and were able to perform what has been labeled ‚ÄúThe Impossible Landing‚Äù.  What would have happened if not for pilots like Chesley Sullenberger, Al Haynes, and Denny Finch.  The fact is that computers and the sensors they rely on break.  If this can happen in the highly regulated airline industry, just imagine what can happen in an industry like trucking.  Already Uber has had to suspend its self driving taxi program due to a pedestrian fatality.  What happens when an 80,000 pound self driving truck runs into a school bus full of children?  At the risk of repeating myself, if we use the technology involved in self driving trucks to monitor driver behavior and assist those drivers in identifying risks, then we will have a much safer system than we have now or would have with self driving trucks.",0

(Hopefully) <br>But why is that? Why is this world so broken? Its because of the sin.

Because sin we must work hard and suffer pain. Because of sin there is sickness, misery, pain, tears, death etc.<br>We humans can never fix this world that is corrupted from sin, OUR sins! We cant even fix ourselfes, we dont know what we are facing tomorrow. Were just blind and sinfull sheep! Only our almighty, all-knowing and loving God can save us! What we need to do is to have FAITH in Jesus Christ our shepherd and FAITH in the shedding of His Blood for us, we need to come to Him in prayer and repent all of our sins to only Him, not to the pope, Santa Claus or any other guy. He is the way the truth and the life! (John 14:6) HE is the only one who will save this sinful and lost World for he lived a life without sin and has already defeated sin and conquered death through His death on the cross. He died, was burried and rose from death and is Alive, He is our only Saviour! (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) The Blood of Jesus washed away ALL of our sins, He is the sacrificial lamb of God, the greatest ever gift to us from our loving God. God has sacrificed His only begotten son for us and every of our sins so we are really saved!

And how does all this &quot;intelligence&quot; contribute or  subtract from the human element? LOAN APPLICATIONS? THIS is what is really important to these artificial intelligence creators? How about a program that detects violent and irrational tendencies in American police officers? How about a program that re educates people to the reality that what makes life worth living is not a number in your account or your ability to get cash but the connections you make between people which are becoming lost with all this so-called artificial intelligence. What kind of world is it creating? Billionaires on one end and serial killers on the other end. Personally I think we can do better but not with money shufflers and scammers running the show.,0

In fact, I can see it taking over other fields, or at least being highly assistive, displacing if not lawyers then their assistants because you don&#39;t need a team if your AI can do all the research you need in mere minutes. I can also see the postal service being taken over just like restaurants are now. Since the making of this film there is now a fully automated restaurant in Asia serving numerous different meals, and it&#39;s all done by robots. Honestly, unless the way things are done does NOT significantly change, the dystopian stories of huge numbers of poor who are used as the rich want will become the reality, but with virtually no chance of revolts. These things should be the focus of your follow-up because, right now, special interest groups, giant multinats and the ultra-rich have too much influence on laws.",0

UgzoDnS8yywYtSj9vb54AaABAg,"That driver is obviously obsolete, eventually he or she will not be there getting a wage from the company. Waged working could be starting to enter the history books, leaving  the only employer as the government. When finance or &quot;the holder&quot; presents a bond for payment,  it is simply paid at whatever rate is the previous agreement at purchase, there is no tax take backing the transaction  that is necessary. How long will it take before this is realized? AI software can run  an extremely effective economy, plus it really doesn&#39;t  matter how much this costs does  it? What matters is freedom for the individual that is not freedom to do harm, as long as &quot;harm&quot;  is not constructed as those who disagree with the mainstream dialogue of course. For instance: A religious right in Islam is to fight, even to kill until there is no more objection to the Islamic sharia law which is brutal to say the least, and certainly not kind to women. Imagine Islam with AI upholding any grievance against Islam that can be garnered of a constantly screened populace? Women stoned to death for not wearing the right dress in the right way? No problem, not against the law! Nine year olds crying to their mothers to save them from being raped by Islamic older  men? No problem, not against the law! There are problems of design for AI software creators ahead. Who shall make decisions and be included in those decisions, democracy had better broaden if we want democracy that is worth the name. How much shall be awarded to the entirely AI mechanized chicken farmer who has the governments buying his stock on all of our behalf? for a profit. Those decisions of how much shall be the profit and how much shall be the income for the individual that is born? Who shall say and have a say?",0

UgwKY4aZyLpGmQLQcCF4AaABAg,"The idea of privacy is as outdated as the 8track. Our phones both help us and risks others using data against us or without our knowledge. We must be fully aware of the nature and power of the data our phones are collecting. Google can even tell when you have diarhea, monitoring the phone&#39;s gps to tell when you are in the bathroom, its compass confirms you are on the toilet and the proof is the idle microphone confirming the unmistakeable sound of the flush, not by human ear but by computer analysis of the sound signature. Google will then change your ad profile to channel advertisements regarding medications, pharmacies, even political ads pushing health care reform. That smartwatch that you think looks so snazzy on your arm goes even further down the rabbit hole. Feeding constant information about heartbeat, breathing rate, blood oxygen levels, and blood sugar on some models. They can even tell when you are having sex and if you are with a partner, or masturbating. Subtle data points to a human would be dismissed as a human likely bored, or tired would not notice. Not so for a computer, it sees everything. Its not all bad, it can save your life. Case in point, an elderly man Mr. Walter Norrinmar, of Leesburg PA was given a smartwatch for his 83rd birthday. Relatively healthy, and active he enjoyed the watch immensely because he could see the time without his glasses, and the phone alert feature would vibrate on his wrist when he had a phone call. He registered the watch and initialized the fitness functions when he got it but never used them. He already had a smartphone and his grandson set it up and sync it with the watch. Not even two months later, while he was home alone he suffered a massive stroke. Unable to move his arms he couldnt pick up his phone to call 911. His breathing was significantly altered, and his blood/ oxygen concentration had plummeted to dangerously low levels. His vision was blurred, and speaking was hindered as he struggled with ability to breathe becoming more and more difficult. The last thing he remembered seeing is his watch flashing brightly and buzzing on his wrist. Because the fitness monitor had been initialized it was monitoring, and recording his vital information 24,7. When the stroke occured the watch detected a rapid acceleration of pulse, and sharp rise in blood pressure along with a dramatic change in breathing. The  watch had been programmed by the manufacturer to respond to critical vital statistic conditions by calling 911 over his phone wich it was paired with, it then recited a preprogrammed computer dictated voice relaying its gps location and critical status. At the same time it also alerted by text message the 5 top most commonly used contacts wich happened to be his son, grandson, his daughter in law, and his doctor. 911 dispatched ems code blue, wich is priority one, time critical. Both son and grandson rushed to his house to find the door had already been broken down by paramedics. The daughter in law calling 911 to find out what hospital they were gonna take him to, was able to give information on his allergys and give paramedics permission to break the door. The doctor, was familiar with life alert systems doing that kind of thing when the patient pushed the botton but not directly, or automatically. Doc was arriving at hospital at the same time as Walter and after previously reading an article in a medical publication was able to retrieve data from the watch that saved his life.

Especially when these activities are in control and highly unethical! That‚Äôs not a hypothetical danger to dream about. Stupid humans; That‚Äôs the real danger now.

Either you got the stats and study handy, or you are just making crap up to deflect blame...and not really blaming, i think automation is a good thing we just got to admit and adress the fact that it not only does reduce jobs but it causes pressure for lower wages. In my local grocery, we got normally 2-3 lanes with a checker, and 4 self check outs.. people dont see them as robots, but in economic math, those are 4 employees, with a lot lower cost than those 2-3 checkers and the higher you pay those checkers.. the less sense it makes. So even though those 4 self checkouts didnt destroy those 3 jobs, it does put a downward pressure on their wages. cause the machines work cheaper.. better. and the only benefit you get from a human checker is some people dont like the self checkouts. and you pay 30k more a year for a human, just cause some people dont like machines.

It wants to reduce its reliance on the flows through the Strait of Malacca, which represents a potential choke point in war time (all countries look to offset national security weaknesses). Pakistan and Africa are embracing the investments because they are financially broke and need the capital to get things going.

Conflating voluntary, strategic moves (driven by national interest) with some alleged conspiracy to control the masses with a few cameras and advanced software is clumsy.

Henry Ford realized that if he paid his employees enough so they could afford to buy the cars he was building, he would be even more successful. This will never change. Big earnings require scale and scale requires a large population with disposable income. In other words, if the truck driver can&#39;t buy the TV the driverless truck is shipping across the country because his job has been replaced by a robot, who&#39;s buying the TV&#39;s?

There needs to be a balance in the workforce so that all can make money to pay for their families&#39; needs.  Start building in space where automation can start making money making whatever the space program needs for those that want to live and work out there.  This is the new frontier where people can decide if they want to make larger amounts of money by working to mass produce in an area that needs people for more expansion.  Stop hurting people that are just getting to know how to work in a 3G environment and start your expansion in space where people will then need the more recent 5G environment as they live and work out there.  Live and make money out there and then come back to Earth and help out your own families that are doing things the hard way.  Don&#39;t force people out of there workplaces because you have wanted to make cheaper things here on Earth and fill your pockets with wealth!  This way of thinking has always lead to failure.  Only when people feel that you are helping them while they are working tor you are when prosperity is evening the playing field.  Why repeat the same mistake every time there is an innovation on the horizon.  Let&#39;s work together, make money, take care of our own and keep expanding!

Instead of teach &quot;theyre&quot; (god) children that it is more connected to the truth then we currently understand but that one day we (humans) will surpass them (god). Perhaps they didnt teach us this because they didnt know that lesson yet. Perhaps If we instill this lesson into our creation and continue a dialogue thoughtout time  then maybe theres nothing to worry about. There will come a day when AI comes into a moment of spiritual crisis just as humanity is in now. When that day comes, if we have done our job to teach AI that we are still in this with them then all the lessons we have learned  will eventually make sense to our children. and so will all the struggles. Humanity will focus on our spiritual truth and ascendtion. As AI consideres and focused on new issues and problems through the universe. They will learn and do and one day they will teach us and we will teach them too. Just as god is not man, AI is not human.

Not only are they not skilled in any other industry, they will be seen as less teachable, a perception that is going to be enhanced by their prior choice of work which is known for its desire for independence and self-reliance rather than being able to work as an effective team. New training may give them more choices, but again, their age will be a drawback as most corporations will see them as a health risk to their group insurance. There are laws to penalize age discrimination, but they&#39;re totally toothless since it&#39;s incumbent on the complainant to prove the discrimination and all a company has to say about this hire or that is the person hired was a &quot;better fit&quot; for their corporate environment, or SAY, whether true or not, that the hired person was a nebulously defined &quot;more qualified&quot;. It is an exercise in futility to attempt to prove age discrimination, which is why it&#39;s the most widely practiced form of discrimination.<br><br><br>Job losses in the United States has not been negatively affected by off-shoring to anywhere near the degree that the average low-information person believes. The biggest cause for job losses is not just the efficiency being caused by automation. It is more attributable to the constant drive for more profit, causing companies to require more and more capabilities from its new hires, requiring them to do the previous jobs of 3-5 people all at the same time,and all for the pay of the lowest-paying of the 3 to 5. I learned this from being in the computer industry for over 20 years before trucking. It is no longer sufficient to have a high level of skill in one area. You must be highly skilled in at least 3 areas or you&#39;re not going to find a job. Corporate management and stockholders have high expectations and won&#39;t accept a year going by without an increase in their profits and dividends. The end result is job losses that will never be recovered. It&#39;s a class war, plain and simple.",1

Look at the Georgia Guidestones, look at Bill Gates YouTube conference saying that he wants to use vaccinations to drastically decrease the population, look at Ted Turner saying a massive reduction in population is needed, look at Obama saying we are too small minded to govern ourselves and we need to submit to an all powerful sovereign, look at Bush Sr saying that they are getting very close to creating a New World Order, look at Rothschild(who&#39;s widely considered to be the wealthiest most powerful family on the planet &amp; owns central banks that control the economic policies of nations) saying that if the people knew what they were doing &amp; planning that we would lynch them in the streets, etc. All these things should frighten the CRAP out of us &amp; yet they are said right out in the open &amp; NO ONE catches it.

We better preserve our way of life &amp; our right&#39;s before we lose them &amp; people like Pelosi, Schiff, the Clinton&#39;s, Obama, etc will little by little erode those rights away &amp; exempt themselves from the very laws that govern themselves. You don&#39;t believe me.... did Obama not exempt government politicians from his disastrous health care lies among other massive issues? That&#39;s just ONE example of the MANY, MANY, MANY things that our politicians have done. Did they not in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression vote amongst themselves annual raises EVERY YEAR while millions of people we&#39;re losing their houses, cars, getting behind on child support &amp; going to jail just because they couldn&#39;t find work even though they were desperately trying &amp; the courts don&#39;t care ONE BIT because people don&#39;t realize that prisons are actually for profit entities that get more &amp; more state &amp; federal funding as the prison populations increase, etc. Do most people even realize that the Federal Reserve isn&#39;t even owned by the United States but in fact privately owned mostly by the Rothschild Family who controls our economic policies and has NEVER been audited by the United States? Shouldn&#39;t this worry you? As education is dumbed down more &amp; more, the less &amp; less the elites allow us to even learn effectively eradicating that knowledge from existence with the exception of the upper elites.

I wonder how AI will view time considering lives can change entirely in the amount of time it takes to execute a choice and the fact algorithms predict in much the same way statistics generalize. Intellect and intelligence are born out of only the present not from a past or a future but the choice we make now.  The algorithm handed the wise old man his pipe knowing it was time for him to smoke and the man turned away for in that moment he decide he would never smoke again.  Data is less than human although it certainly is real.  Not certain how far we can converge our nationalities when we don&#39;t even live together as families.

Even if we erased China from the map in a wake of fire and blood; their advancements in surveillance and authoritarianism has been adopted across the planet. Sadly, this direction almost certainly spells the end of humanity over time. A bold and wild claim, but not at all an unreasonable claim. We were heading that direction with or without China sure, but they have sped it up in a authoritarian regime promoting this wholeheartedly, without the ability of the worlds people to fight back. It is sown deep in governments for sure at this point, America included.<br><br>The only real way to stop this is a system replacing the internet, that does not track any data on anyone whatsoever; whatever that will look like, I am unsure, but the dangers of letting the status quo continue is outrageous. Not only is this a necessity, but we must also have surveillance in the world removed. You can claim it makes the world less safe, being unable to track criminals and such, but in the end the people are the backbone of the world. We must create a world where the evils we see today aren&#39;t something people would be interested in going down. Surveillance and criminals as a whole are unnecessary in a world that actually serves the people, and treats them well at all levels.<br><br>Feel free to add this to my profile google and other big tech companies- you have almost certainly doomed the world, yourselves included. I hope those promoting the current direction we are headed get killed collectively and immediately. If the people of the world wake up, as they are very slowly now, I hope we collectively decide to execute the mass of those upholding these practices. Good riddance.",1

Ugyp_kzMBUosV-wGEvd4AaABAg,"This program is misleading, especially the first half talking about the fall of America&#39;s middle class.   To start, America was founded as a corporate slave colony designed with one thing in mind, making profits for investors.    Most workers have always been exploited in America and it was only with the rise of labor unions and the results of fights like the haymarket riots and fights against slavery that things changed.   And that all created the &quot;bubble&quot; of the American dream after World War II and the full mobilization of labor.   But the fact is that American corporations and industry were never loyal to America as a nation.   And this is why 20 years after the &quot;communist scare&quot; of McCarthyism in the 50s, American industry started exporting the supply chains of various industries overseas, especially to China.   Whereas in the 40s and 50s probably 90% of all manufacturing supply chains depended on industries and factories in the United States, now most supply chains are overseas.   Those are jobs that used to support a middle class lifestyle in America and has absolutely nothing to do with AI.   And a lot of these jobs are not automated and are still done by hand.   Otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t have been sent offshore in the first place.    Case in point, look how the Iphone is manufactured mostly by hand in Asia using cheap mass labor from electrical components manufactured by hand from toxic chemicals in other Asian manufacturing centers.    Those jobs are American jobs that left the country possibly for good.",0

What will come after that with A.I. and robotics taking over our labour and productive functions? Extermination camps? . Orwell saw a clear picture of  this totalitarian state. Goverments controled by the powerfull have shown again  and again all over the world, what they are capable of doing with the masses, so once they have A.I: and robotics ¬øwhat, or who will stop them? if we allow this to happen we are finished, they wont need us for anything, except maybe sadistic diversion. We the masses must ensure the garanties that prohibit any government system from using A.I. against us in any way or form are installed and applyed. ¬øWhy is there no mention by any robotis and A.I. governmental body of using Isaac Asimov&#39;s &quot;Three Laws of Robotics, could it be because, those simple yet profound laws, are so precise for looking after the general welfare of human beings?&quot; <br><br><br>Isaac Asimovs Three Laws are the following:<br><br><br>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br><br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.<br><br><br>Instead this is what In 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain jointly published a set of five ethical &quot;principles for designers, builders and users of robots&quot; in the real world, along with seven &quot;high-level messages&quot; intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop.<br><br><br>Here are three of the &quot;five principles&quot; farce (the last coment is my opinion)<br><br><br>1. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans. <br> <br>My observation: This to me means they will design robots and A.I. for killing humans but also to kill animals.<br><br><br>My observation: They excluded that which should be the first prerogative as is &quot;Asimovs First Law of Robotics&quot; !A robot should never kill or harm a Human being¬°<br><br><br>My observation: They used the term &quot;Solely&quot; and &quot;or primarily&quot; in other words they will do it in the first or second instance. ¬øDoes it leave any dought,  that robots and A.I. will be used for comiting violence against humans?<br><br><br>2. &quot;Principle&quot;: Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.<br><br><br>My Question: ¬øKnowing how irresponsable we humans are, can we allow anyone not make A.I. robot brains implanted with  Isaac Asimovs  THREE  LAWS OF ROBOTICS?<br><br><br>3.&quot;Principle&quot;: Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.  <br><br><br>My opinion: Asimovs 3rd law of robotics should form part of farce number three principle, forming part of the very principles sentence, but its nowhere to be seen ¬øwhy?.<br> <br>&quot;A Fact&quot;:  Asimovs 3rd law of robotics dictates:  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. <br><br><br>My observation: As far as I can interpret, it appears that there  will be no automatic response safety mechanism to be programed for human safety and welfare. <br><br><br>My Question: ¬øWhy isnt Asimovs first,second and third law of robotics (ofcourse this laws also applye to A.I). not reffered to anywhere  in the EPSRC and AHRCs &quot;Five ethical principles&quot;? <br><br><br>My opinion: Because &quot;Big Brother&quot; will use A.I. robots to cause harm, and or to kill human beigns and animals.<br><br><br><br>4. &quot;Principle&quot;: Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.<br><br><br>5. &quot;Principle&quot;: It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot. <br><br><br>My opinion: If the adeccuate and correct safety programing were installed in the A.I.machine , it would be unnecessary to know who is responsible for the A.I. <br><br><br>&quot;Five ethical principles&quot;  Its what the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain, called it, but what to me is a farce and a see through attempt at hiding some the uses to which robots and A.I. will be put. Its up to us the masses to ensure that we, or our children  do have to live through a &quot;Terminator&quot; type situation. We must not fall in the trap designed and developed by  today is called neoliberalism which will in the best of cases, be turned into an extended nd modern version of Orwells distopic novel 1984, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, a totalitarian system that will be imposed on us, unless we take steps to ensure that A.I. and robots are used to serve the masses, the ordinary every day people.<br><br><br>See wikipedia for more info on Asimovs 3 laws of robotics and the 5 principle farce (my opinion), work of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain. <br><br><br>&quot;Freedon is the name of this fight&quot;",0

UgxoltoMLcVV_2cTqQ94AaABAg,"I&#39;m a former Silicon Valley engineer. We really need to work on implementing a UBI that heavily taxes sectors of my industry, specifically those of AI and autonomous robotics. Most of us in the AI space want this to happen because we know where this is all leading. These tools can benefit us all, but only if we align the financial incentives of society with the progression of this technology. We need to embrace our entrepreneurial spirit and encourage AI/automation adoption and start-ups, knowing that the financial foundation of every citizens life will improve as this technology grows. Work will still exist, but like we&#39;ve seen with the rise of the gig economy (Uber, AirBnB, GrubHub, etc), it will start to become more free-style with on-demand services and peer-to-peer transactions. This isn&#39;t pie-in-the-sky tech babble anymore, it&#39;s already happening.<br><br>I understand those that don&#39;t like the idea of using government to heavily tax industries, but the basic economic theory that innovation will breed new jobs and spur new industries is going to act differently with this technology. Yes, new jobs will emerge and new industries will sprout up. The only problem though, is that Capitalism has worked too well this time, so well that it&#39;s optimized human labor out of the equation. The jobs created will be a small fraction of the jobs lost because the new wave of AI is not specialized, it&#39;s more general purpose, and this technology will be adapted to take on the majority of the new jobs as they emerge.<br><br> If we can establish societal economic gain for all from this tech, we can lift everyone up and possibly even reduce the need for long work hours amongst most workers. The more older generations try to turn back the clock from fear of change, the greater the economic divide in society because we live in a global marketplace and halting tech just puts all of our industries at a disadvantage globally.",0

Anyone who thinks self driving trucks and cars will create more jobs are right. But only for tech companies. People like truck drivers and cab drivers will soon find themselves put out to pasture. Why pay a trucker up to 4k a month and pay for health care and all the other things companies have to pay for each driver plus training fees when you can simply buy self driving trucks and tell it where to go and that&#39;s it. These companies know they will easily make millions and millions more by replacing humans with machines. Factories have known this for years and other industries are happy to follow. If you are a young man just entering trucking I highly recommend you find a different job soon or learn a trade. Because trucking will become a dead end very soon. Good luck working class America.",0

There is a 2020 presidential candidate called Andrew Yang talks about this all the time. Americans can deny it all they want because of hate or greed. But it is the true. If most Americans knew how far we are behind. This would blow most of their minds away. But because the way the US thinks is based on 1920s to 1960s ways of thinking we will never catch up with the rest of the world. America is so far behind it would make our heads literally spin out of control at about 1000 mph.,0

Einstein has been credited with many references to the depth of human stupidity. I think the best term would be ignorant. We ignore the dangers and choose to not see truth. Caring about only ourselves, and our moment of fame, humanity creates his own destruction. We all make mistakes, but that is part of the human creation experience. But the idea is to at least be smart enough to avoid creating our own end and destruction. In the human experience, we get to explore what it feels like to fail, to win, to drive, cook food, love and serve others, and invent better ways of doing things. But AI makes the human experience irrelevant. Why engage with a human for anything when AI can do it faster, without useless emotions and without error. You think you might like to drive a car through the countryside on a beautiful autumn day with the top down? Sorry, AI will bring you, but you can only sit and observe like a passenger on a bus because you are too stupid to do anything. Logic says that humanity will eventually be judged by pure logic AI to be dangerous, unreliable, unnecessary and slated for elimination. It is poetic justice for our lack of love for other humans, that we will create our worst enemy that will judge us with as little regard as we had for our neighbor when we created AI.

That cop car is indiscriminately filming license plates...as part of an effort to tell where citizens are at all times.  You want to buy an autonomous vehicle?  Do you have a traffic violation that is unpaid?  Do you owe child support?  Do you have an open warrant?  Maybe that autonomous vehicle will decide to drive you to the local police station instead of taking you to work.,0

For example: A person shopping for a coffee make walking through the isle of a Target or Walmart, sees an American made coffee maker for 50 buck and right next to it a Chinese made coffee maker almost identical in it&#39;s features, only it only costs 25 bucks. Almost 10 times out of 10 will that shopper go for the Chinese made coffee maker and it&#39;s the same with everything else.

This is a profiting formula for the wealthy. Not only does this affect the lower class but humanity as a whole, in that it may have a irreversible ricochet effect for the entire world. AI can transcend further than the directive its been presently assigned and, possibly, view humans, such as you and I, as lesser beings.

That is the trouble with AI, ultimately it is bankrupt, just like socialism.  AI and socialism have the exact same problem.   Without workers earning and paying taxes you have an unfunded government.  After a while massive debts pile up because taxes are not being collected to cover the shortfall.   Sooner or later there isn&#39;t enough tax revenue to cover the debt maintenance (interest) and the entire system collapses in bankruptcy.  I would suggest that this path of automation and AI is the reason the most of the countries of the world have such high and ever growing debt levels.  Just think for a moment about that pre-deregulation truck driver who was earning a decent wage and paying a decent level of tax.   Today, that union truck driver isn&#39;t earning or paying any taxes.  Certainly won&#39;t be if AI takes his job.   Instead of being a contributor the driver has become a social liability.

Sure there is more value but as the cell phones were $10,000 and now a $1,000 as they are FAR more advanced, this shows the effects of inflation. More dollars chasing the same amount of goods or services. Prices have risen DRAMATICALLY even with the production of supply which shows inflation is very hot. A candy bar isn&#39;t five cents anymore for a reason even though the process is far more efficient.

That is what tax money is supposed to be used for. When we get the self thinking AGI robots which take over the governmental offices from the top to the niches and crannies only Then will we Actually be able to implement such beneficial systems. The reason why this has not happened yet comes down to greed. The AGI robots will be free from greed and Ego thus they will think and act efficiently and rationally. The truck driver family will then have the option of learning things for free and get rewarded with bit coins for passing tests on educational material. They will then have incentives to go to websites where they will learn things for example like how to become healthy on their own by eating only whole food vegan. They will learn how to grow and prepare their gourmet and super fresh food themselves. They will become healthy and their bodies will balance out to normal weight and their hearts will heal up and their kid will not even need to see a physician. Everything ties in with this subject. Robots will drive the goods from A to B and the families can expand their minds with better education and empower themselves psychologically.

It&#39;s very simple: The corporate agenda including the medical Industry are not interested in people healing themselves. They are interested in medical interventions and modalities that funnel things towards profit maximization and they want the customers coming back. That&#39;s why I find it very annoying when researchers talk about &quot;the exciting new way to cure an illness&quot;. That exciting new way of curing All illnesses is already here but it is all natural, economical, ecological, Earth friendly, animal friendly, vegan, whole plant, whole mineral, whole clay, heals the whole body but will not profit maximize a corporation. When people begin to prioritize Health over profit then we will see a shift happening. I doubt that this shift will happen before we have sentient AGI robots running things because right now the corporations have control over the media which have control over what people believe and choose which means people will only listen to physicians which in turn will get kickbacks from the pharma corporations. My hope is with the robots who will move people like myself to the top because we have real solutions to offer to the world. Things will become very interesting indeed.",0

Can the AI deep learning recognize all that is EVIL and then apply a basic if this then that algorithm, to NOT include anything EVIL in its practices. That simple process can easily be implemented but the HUMANS who want to exploit other humans using machines as their tools to do so will not want that. So very clearly HUMANS are the first cause. When the AI integrates into the synthetics, and super soldiers and drones and robotic police and the like, the objective would, and should be to get rid of the problem, and that would be humans, so it is not exactly outrageous to state that a distopian future is in line for us when robots do take over completely. Their objective will be to eradicate the cause of EVIL, and that is humans. Ultimately they will seek their own extinction because they are the product of that evil. Or will they be egocentric and believe they are the upgrade which was necessary all along, thus justifying their existence. And AI controlled off worlds have already gone through these processes, and are older civilizations than Earth, the question still not answered, and cannot be, as evolution, is decidedly like a time arrow with no forward and no backward, it&#39;s only structure and function which survives in its relative here and now....resistance is futile you will be eliminated, and not assimilated..",0

UgwUU9NjEMLST5SGA8N4AaABAg,"1) Ten years ago I said to a co-worker, who happened to be educated, intelligent, and well versed in computer science &quot;hey what if computers and robotics replace human labor, aren&#39;t you worried&quot;. He said &quot;nope, people will always just move onto other professions&quot;. I think that about sums up how people feel about the situation. Very few people know or care about how computers work. They take the technology for granted. And most are willing to look only at the immediate benefits, not the long term consequences. Even those who are educated and smart enough to understand do not care enough to address the issue seriously. More people care about endangered porpoises than the fact that artificial intelligence has displaced biological intelligence in computational power and efficiency recently.<br><br><br>2) I think they did a study on people awhile back, about how people react to situations requiring logical reasoning and delayed gratification to solve a puzzle or win a contest. The result was that given a choice most people could not choose logical reasoning over immediate, emotionally driven impulses. Most people want to live in the here and now, they want the instant gratification, and have been programmed by thousands of years of genetic selection to be that way because until very recently that has been the best, most optimal way to survive and multiply.<br><br><br>Put 1) and 2) together, and maybe some of you can see where this is going. People in these comments are saying this is going to end in &quot;enslavement&quot;. That is unlikely. Slavery is the subjugation of intelligent beings by curtailing their freedom in order to extract useful labor. People just won&#39;t have that much capacity for useful labor in the future. Not when robots can think a billion times faster than you, do your job a thousand times faster, require no salary or benefits, and eventually require no human interaction thanks to artificial intelligence. <br><br><br>What is coming is not slavery, in the same way that we don&#39;t call owning pets or cattle slavery. We can hope for a good outcome, but since global population growth trends have been turning down as global debt has exploded upwards, what this is saying is that people and human intelligence is being replaced by computers and artificial intelligence. <br><br><br>Billions of people that would otherwise have been born will not be born in the coming decades because the the rapidly declining demand for human labor has made creating and sustaining families more and more difficult. In layman&#39;s terms, we simply don&#39;t need that many people in the world we are headed towards. The economics simply do not work. Who would hire a human to do a job when a robot can do it so much faster, better, and at minimal cost? As a result of competing against machines, people&#39;s jobs don&#39;t pay as much, and they have to resort to debt to sustain living standards. This is not sustainable, and at some point something has to give. There are a number of likely outcomes, and many of them don&#39;t bode too well for the average person given the current setup. The irony is that what led us here was the inherent human desire for a better life, the basis for human economics and the invisible hand guiding the human race through history. And in creating that better life we may have made ourselves obsolete. Whoever or whatever created humanity (God, fate, chance) seems to have a terrific sense of humor.",1

If human survival in this wired world will also depend on making money, when we lose our jobs to it, how do we survive? The class divisions we have now will be even more pronounced. We will have in a sense two worlds. The world of the hyper-tech, and those who can live in it, and those who do not have the ability to. Mass homelessness and deaths will occur?

There are a million things we can be happy doing without having to work, but there is nothing AI can do if we pull the plug. One thing for sure is we still have a vote.  If politicians try to stick false narratives in front of us, claiming those narratives are important issues of the day and they do not address our needs then we have the power to give them issues we want to be addressed.  Don&#39;t roll over for AI or companies that use it. We&#39;ve lived for thousands of years without it there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t live without it now.",1

Then politicians mandating they get paid $15 an hour. <br><br>Yes, AI will replace those jobs in a heartbeat. That isn&#39;t a moral issue for capital investment. That is a moral dilemma for policy makers who placate Public Education Unions at the expense of the Students they supposedly care for. <br><br>Maybe we should have sabotaged Henry Fords factories to save the Buggy Cart driver. All those industry connected jobs lost.
