Ugz5tdUSQSZnVhH3n5l4AaABAg,demis is by 2 orders of magnitude smarter than Lex Drechsel University I block everyone fraudman,0
UgxuzDtAJLNqqIM_boN4AaABAg,fraudman is so underqualified,0
UgzrYz4pSwV4H5NNOIJ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m not doubting any of this,  but I would just like to know how you checked the result <br>of the protein folding done by Alpha Fold 2 and prove that they were not hallucinations <br>and in fact is true &amp; correct.  I&#39;m  glad that you guys are around and I just <br>want to add that AI is the best invention ever done by man.",0
Ugx_H0GzccIOKmT6DRh4AaABAg,"Robert Zwanzig, a premier figure in Statistical Mechanics, used simple models to illustrate the speed of protein folding. He basically one of the fathers of modern statistical physics. Along with JW Gibbs, JG Kirkwood, PG Wolynes,  D Chandler etc, etc. AlphaFold predicts the structure, but is not in the business of predicting the dynamics of the fold. There is a gigantic volume of work by leaders in stat mech unknown to people in &quot;Computer Science&quot;. Speaking of which, a large team appears to have worked on AlphaFold,  the lead of which was John Jumper, who did his Ph.D on protein folding under another prominent stat mech professor, Karl Freed from U Chicago. What I am trying to convey is the scope of this is beyond: Alphafold is &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;, who with nothing less than a pen an paper, could convey grand ideas with the simplest of models, and that is true genius. Jumping back today,  Frank Noe from Germany is perhaps the best able to bridge both worlds at this moment and communicate connections from different field.  All best.<br><br>As a side note JW Gibbs was an incredible American scientist in the 1800s who created much of the foundations/machinery  of statistical mechanics that is used today. Just looking at his &quot;Elementary principles of statistical mechanics&quot; published in 1902 is awe inspiring. He is probably one of the least known, appreciated American physicists but hugely influential to developments in 20th century.",1
UgyqjjCQrd0w_yUD5ZV4AaABAg,"AlphaFold and Folding@home are both important tools in the field of protein folding research, but they serve different purposes. AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence program that predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences with high accuracy ¬π. On the other hand, Folding@home is a distributed computing project that simulates protein folding and other molecular dynamics on a large scale ¬≤. <br><br>While AlphaFold has made significant advances in the field of protein structure prediction, it does not replace the need for experimental validation or other computational methods such as Folding@home ¬≥.

Ugy_PYoEXky4-rIp2JF4AaABAg,Thanks lex invite ilya back on the show too !!!,0
UgyvoTbBYpEPoZw4nXh4AaABAg,RIP to the phds that were halfway through their work to figure out how to solve one proteins folding when this tech was released,1

UgwgTwwBbjKUxy3oXL54AaABAg,Proteins do not have a genetic sequence. Their primary structure is an amino acid sequence. He‚Äôs confusing genomics with proteomics. Completely different fields.,0

UgxjE6hqOGEXrFHYYaJ4AaABAg,"This is the most exciting thing to me. Protein folding is essential in so many areas of biology and thus improving the physical human condition. Any of these look asymmetric, which reminds me of something Claude Shannon said that puzzled me at first, that a chaotic random message contains more information than one that is not chaotic or random. Are various aspects of biology difficult to crack because they are produced in random processes?",0

Ugxv_HDq_Dbw37_r-QN4AaABAg,This is really mind blowing stuff. Lex made a good point about Demis making &quot;notes in the margins&quot;  Funny but very true.,2
UgxVf5VWOfvAjWnOCPZ4AaABAg,"It&#39;s funny how AlphaFold becomes a thing, rather than a set of properties of a computer, by virtue of the fact that it describes a set of properties of something else. I think it might be hard shells with fleshy innards all the way down.",0

Ugx5mOzcyY_xKzJgf5p4AaABAg,"Take a look at what the thief apes do to my country (the Jungle laws that suits the apes!) <br>Steve Tone Libya is an occupied country, under direct foreign military occupation, all that was under the auspices of the Western United Nations and under direct mandate.<br>Why don&#39;t the Libyans use their brains?!<br>Instead of foreign countries, especially the United States of America, England, Turkey, Italy and Russia, managing what is happening in Libya behind the scenes using unelected puppets, the Libyans demand that the criminal himself (the tool for implementing criminal plans, the Western United Nations) take over the rule instead of running the government in secret.<br>Those who rule now have been brought by foreign countries to serve their criminal plans.<br>The Western United Nations takes power directly for a period of only 6 months, during that parliamentary and presidential elections should be held and a referendum will should held on the draft constitution of the international criminal organization of the Muslim Brotherhood or the Kingdom‚Äôs constitution with the condition that the monarchy clause is removed from it or forward it to a new Committee.<br>Instead of foreign countries managing the crisis in Libya, put them in the forefront, instead of their continuing leadership of looting and devastation behind the scenes to prolong the crisis.<br>This is the only solution currently. Western countries have deliberately diluted the situation in Libya so that there are no longer elected legitimate bodies to be replaced by the alleged international legitimacy as an alternative to the legitimacy of the Libyan people through elections, and the United States of America is recently working to withdraw the remainder of the outgoing parliament  In favor of the international criminal organization of the Muslim Brotherhood, represented by the unelected State Council, to further aggravate the situation in Libya.<br>Why not to put the real criminal in front instead of continuing to rule and looting behind the scenes using unelected puppets to prolong the crisis?!<br>The Western United Nations has supervised the bringing of the Turkish occupier, mercenaries and terrorist groups to Libya under the false pretext of confronting the Russians, and they already know very well that the Turks and the Russians are allies in occupying and plundering weak countries.<br>The dominant apes have no chance to build human civilization!  Only humans can, the only thing the apes can do is staying as a curse on mankind and human civilization! <br>real curse on all mankind.",0

UgxMHwgmBNdAs-3nKZB4AaABAg,"It&#39;s fascinating that we are simply hairless apes that learned to write 5000 years ago and we are already decoding and manipulating the structure and mechanics of the cell.<br><br>from the 6.5&#39; long strand of computer programming (DNA) to the very mechanical helicase enzyme that spins at 10,000 rpm to unstitch the DNA strand for replication... the whole thing just smacks of rather simple, nano technology.

Ugyg3Wl2h38nXBDsg-V4AaABAg,There are so many scientific breakthroughs in each calendar year now that my brain can barely comprehend. We are mapping so many processes at the same time now that it&#39;s only our emotional neoteny that keeps us from solving the huge problems of human life. Our hearts need to catch up to our minds. I have hope for this.,29
