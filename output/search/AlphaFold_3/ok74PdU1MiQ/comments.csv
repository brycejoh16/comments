UgxWW8nu10oDlLVmakd4AaABAg,"Chinese mother?<br>I bet this man&#39;s life was a living hell growing up. (I was in China for years. it&#39;s not a stereotype. One mother wouldn&#39;t feed her own son properly, and his summer holidays were an unending series of tests, summer school, and structured learning.) <br>BTW: chess master at 13 is exceptional but, surprisingly, the average IQ of chess masters is about 135.<br>I knew one who was a master at 12, and he was just super neurotic, terrible at Backgammon, always begging me for something to eat because he threw away all his money in bad restaurants with high prices.<br>210 is an impressive number. <br>A high IQ score is: 1) a stupid person&#39;s idea of the most important measure of intelligence; 2) a number that so-called experts frequently conjure out of thin air with scant valid evidence and not much of a clue as to what they are really talking about. <br><br>In fact, &quot;IQ test&quot; is a misnomer. The tests more accurately separate individuals of low to mid-range intellect in order to screen for occupational or academic fitness; scores become increasingly problematic and decreasingly meaningful past something like 155. In our highly competitive culture they have taken on the status of something like &quot;bragging rights&quot;; it would seem that anyone who is successful, rich, or culturally preferred just happens to have an incredibly high IQ number, though often by way of vague supposition or occasional rumor. This would seem to make sense, at first glance; but it is more in the way of a logical fallacy: If a meritocratic society actually achieved something like parity between &quot;real&quot; IQ numbers and associated recognition, then there would seem to be a case for claiming that an instance of high &quot;intelligence&quot; gives evidence for, and is accompanied by, a significant and greater representation of scores that also receive social recognition, either in terms of societal access and fulfillment, or at least in terms of ensuring that even the un-productive member of society be compensated for what is otherwise deemed a noteworthy, commendable &quot;fact in itself&quot;.<br>We do not recognize the genius as we probably should; we know, without doubt, that too many &quot;stupid&quot; people turn up in too many disturbing, and undeserved, places.<br><br>Much in the way of our economic philosophy, our superstitions regarding what things represent tangible goods or services, have a tendency to get in the way of clear thinking in these matters: one takes the IQ score at face value, smiles, turns to important business; one takes all the money one can get, becomes defensive, turns to important business. The reality of &quot;intelligent behavior&quot; just doesn&#39;t make a ding of difference. The price of one&#39;s shoes, the possibility of a handout, make the benchmark standard. <br><br>We know, of course, that the situation runs overwhelmingly against the aforesaid reasonable idea: the true genius is unrecognized and makes no significant (monetary or compensatory) contribution, even when products or &quot;works&quot; of genius are clearly in evidence; similarly, the young prodigy impresses with certain accomplishments, turns away from contributing much afterwards, fades into obscurity.<br>The first case says that we do not give a damn for high intelligence until, right out of the blue, we suddenly do care. The second says that a young Einstein impressed us with something he managed a bit further on than ten or twelve years of age: the imagination and persistence to go along with the endowment of genius, whatever that is.<br><br>In either case, as with many contemporary &quot;success&quot; stories of the business, entertainment, or intellectual spheres, it is debatable whether the measured or alleged IQ score of the individual receiving the &quot;benefit&quot; of the number is doing something significant to carry the &quot;burden&quot; of the intelligence claim, or whether the score itself has any real correlation with whatever the person in question is capable of, is contemplating, or eventually shall do.<br>Too much rides on the true, if obscure, source of success; and, as is well known, many individuals who manage to achieve popular recognition one way or the other, or in spite of what certain intimate associates may know or suspect about them, not infrequently just happen to have, or make visible, a claim for the &quot;proper number&quot; at one time or another; a revelation to which the majority seem privy quite before the fact, and, at any rate, irrespective of any evidence for the &quot;certain fact&quot; beyond the ephemeral, abstract nature or intent of the &quot;thing in itself&quot;.<br><br>We are prone to have the celebrated cerebral fixity of fame just because, in lieu of anything substantive, cerebration is the thing least in evidence. Except when it pays to believe it is most evident of all &quot;other&quot; things. <br><br>This is why (perhaps) the &quot;High IQ&quot; societies generally set a reasonable, statistically reliable score for admission. Too far up the scale, and it&#39;s just a bunch of geniuses arguing like a roomful of idiots -- or the other way round.",0

The formation of &quot;intermediate&quot; assumptions, but knowing that these are only &quot;assumptions&quot; until conclusively proven to be true.  No different than the human intelligence challenge, determining the difference in the processes, that assumptions are only tools, and not truths.

UgwoHU4VXW4MPjE22op4AaABAg,"iq is a reference to a g-score, which is measured by an individual&#39;s responses to verbal cues in problem solving and recall of specific facts and formulas. however, less than 1% of human perception is verbal. the idea of superintelligence is based upon a false premise that intelligence is an entirely verbal phenomenon. in reality, human intelligence is multi dimensional and not based strictly upon the assessment of verbal data. the conversation is misleading precisely because a false premise renders conclusions drawn from it necessarily invalid. the fact that &quot;leading scientists&quot; do not perceive the glaring invalidity of the hypothesis is an indication that only false scientists are afforded the label of scientists. not surprising n the wake of the public perception of what was called a pandemic, but conformed only to pseudo science promoted in the context of &quot;democracy.&quot; humans are in the midst of a neo-bronze age, which entails that the authorities upon which civilization depends for leadership are in fact so anti-intelligent that civilization itself is threatened by its deference to such authorities.",0
