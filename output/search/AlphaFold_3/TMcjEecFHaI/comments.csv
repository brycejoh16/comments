UgyUeBgZ7lXxCPC16U14AaABAg,"Once I have the contacts between structure A and B, is there the possibility to get a list of those contacts (to have a better overview)?",1
UgzV5vgip4ZMC1hr-s94AaABAg,"Hi! Great explanation, thanks for showing the error plot function. I have version 1.5 but when I type the command for contacts between the two chains it says &#39;No residues specified for alphafold contacts&#39;. Could you help me, what am I doing wrong? My guess is that it doesn&#39;t recognize that there are two separate chains?<br><br>Another question: I am not really satisfied with the position in which my protein A is now docked to the other, because I know from literature as well as from experiments I did in the lab that the binding is at a different domain... So would you recommend running alphafold again with some restrictions? Or, if I want try the docking manually: how can I separate the two strands?",1
Ugx7Mguc5YlLVylKiQx4AaABAg,"Excellent videos. But I don&#39;t understand PAE plot. It would be helpful if you said a little more about it. For example, choose some points in the plot and say exactly what they mean",0
Ugw44Vhk5lirac7SwdF4AaABAg,Thanks for sharing!,0
Ugxs_44krsOjuR4G6QV4AaABAg,"When I use the contacts command it doesn&#39;t colour the contacts by PAE, how can I change that?",0
Ugy5pEZz0yr_xrY4j-x4AaABAg,Hi. Thank you for this great tutorial. I&#39;m newbie in protein research. I have been using Alphafold with Chimerax interface for a while. I wonder how to do docking of two different proteins that I downloaded from UniProt to see which part of those proteins interact each other? Is this tutorial also about docking? or just about protein-protein binding? Because I need to learn which part of two proteins interact each other. I&#39;m looking forward to see answers for that. Thanks!,0
Ugw_x5sE1enoOTVesKl4AaABAg,Thank you for your tutorial. I recently faced a problem (or a bug) that I could not get the final results file and  got an error (NotImplementedError: A UTF-8 locale is required. Got ANSI_X3.4-1968) reported in colab.,0
Ugx1OPKBQeRL8xjECbx4AaABAg,"Thanks for the tutorial, it is very helpful. I wonder if ver. 1.5 is released now. I can only find the 1.4 and daily build versions. Do I need to delete the current 1.4 ver. and install the daily build one, or are there any commands to update? Thanks in advance.",0
Ugzyq_ph7MndEiALiUV4AaABAg,"I followed the tutorial to the letter,  when I try to plot the contacts I get the message &quot;Structure best_model.pdb #1 does not have PAE data opened&quot; even though the PAE is right there. Any advice?<br><br>I love your work by the way",0
UgyC0F9lEdWsYYOMb7N4AaABAg,Hi when trying this I get the following error &quot;Structure best_model.pdb #1 does not have PAE data opened&quot; . Do you know how I can solve this?,0
Ugw0aMHUpa5ByCLLOJ94AaABAg,"Iâ€™m also wondering whether bind affinities, and the binding energies could be predicted and shown (as there in many docking platforms)",6
UgyhRMcGwFOPKKzBX1F4AaABAg,Is it possible to find the average PAE for a given site? This would be a nice way of summarizing the evaluation of protein-protein interaction prediction alongside the visual producer,1
UgzzmfpkpFPYkMBwoNd4AaABAg,Could you please demonstrate the tools one could use in chimera to demonstrate the potential effects an Amino acid change would have on a protien structure.,1
UgxsneCO7N-U5xEYp5t4AaABAg,Thank you so much for your active dev of ChimeraX &lt;3 This is a super great feature!!!,9
