UgwRvOMnRGiiy5dfqSF4AaABAg,"yeah but, MIT postdoc Lex Friedman is not part of the Nobel committee so.... I mean the result is great nonetheless. I&#39;m still waiting to hear from scientists in the field developing cures for once impossible to cure diseases. Unless it comes up with new miracle drugs, its a useless data processing machine. I&#39;m worried about the possibility of overtraining of the data. I&#39;m my experience, Neural Nets with no physics or necessary mathematical constraints tend to not go very far in their predictions.",1
Ugw8pK1FQ95WQzHmHDJ4AaABAg,"Hi Professor,<br><br>please recommend: I am trying to decide btwn starting an MS Data Sci program or MS Biomedical Informatics program next month and am unsure. I also have an undergrad background in bio &amp; natural sciences and was thinking a full on Data Sci degree might be better in exposing me to the technical side and leave more options in which sector to work, but idk if Biomed Informatics degree might be better",0
