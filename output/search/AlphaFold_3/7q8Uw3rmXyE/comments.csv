Ugwy1N8mZY1ng-n5jvR4AaABAg,"Robert Zwanzig, a premier figure in Statistical Mechanics, used simple models to illustrate the speed of protein folding. He basically one of the fathers of modern statistical physics. Along with JW Gibbs, JG Kirkwood, PG Wolynes,  D Chandler etc, etc. AlphaFold predicts the structure, but is not in the business of predicting the dynamics of the fold. There is a gigantic volume of work by leaders in stat mech unknown to people in &quot;Computer Science&quot;. Speaking of which, a large team appears to have worked on AlphaFold,  the lead of which was John Jumper, who did his Ph.D on protein folding under another prominent stat mech professor, Karl Freed from U Chicago. What I am trying to convey is the scope of this is beyond: Alphafold is &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;, who with nothing less than a pen an paper, could convey grand ideas with the simplest of models, and that is true genius. Jumping back today,  Frank Noe from Germany is perhaps the best able to bridge both worlds at this moment and communicate connections from different field.  All best.<br><br>As a side note JW Gibbs was an incredible American scientist in the 1800s who created much of the foundations/machinery  of statistical mechanics that is used today. Just looking at his &quot;Elementary principles of statistical mechanics&quot; published in 1902 is awe inspiring. He is probably one of the least known, appreciated American physicists but hugely influential to developments in 20th century.",0

Ugzx7dIt3RKc_nLbUpl4AaABAg,I feel like I&#39;m kind of a smart person. I feel like I kind of understand protein folding. I feel like I kind of understand AI. That was completely Greek to me.,26
