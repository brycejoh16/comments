Just wanted to mention one point, the team consisted of members with the knowledge of structural biology which is a subdivision of molecular biology and biophysics. So technically they weren&#39;t noobs at all but experts in it! Matter of fact, to quote &quot;Structural biology is a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules (especially proteins, made up of amino acids, RNA or DNA, made up of nucleotides, membranes, made up of lipids) how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function.&quot;",0

One thing I wanted to make note of @siraj, Rosetta is actually a suite of protein folding tools and structure predictions (not a visualization tool like pymol for example).
