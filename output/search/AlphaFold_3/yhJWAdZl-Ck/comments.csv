UgwWPybEfWLitdC1GUJ4AaABAg,"The smallest protein known is a 20 amino acid protein called Trp-cage in the saliva of Gila Monsters. The smallest human protein is 44 amino acids but it could be an abortive translation from the 5&#39; UTR of another mRNA. The largest known protein is the human muscle binding protein Titan, which has btween 25,000 and 35,000 amino acids depending u8pon the reading frame for the sequence.<br><br>There are no proteins known which as so small that they are comprised of only 10 amino acids. A typical protein is 300 - 3,000 amino acids long, while thousands of proteins are many hundreds to thousands of amino acids long, and some are tens of thousands of amino acids long. For such a protein to form naturally into a functional form can be calculated. There are 20 amino acids that make up all protiens. Therefore the odds to form a protein comprised of only 10 amino acids (no protein this small is known) by undirected molecular interactions that is functional is 20x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 = <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhJWAdZl-Ck&amp;t=70"">1:10</a>,240,800,000,000.

UgxWNso8eoP64vBFoM54AaABAg,Isn‚Äôt there another issue though? Just predicting is not a theory. The Deep Mind program may be great at predicting but it still doesn‚Äôt tell us WHY those forms and not others. To me it seems analogous to feeding a bunch of data into a program about moving objects so for any new object if you know the force and the mass you can reliably predict the acceleration. That‚Äôs useful but it isn‚Äôt the same as knowing that F = ma. Or perhaps a better example would be predicting orbits and trajectories of objects in space. Being able to predict via analyzing data isn‚Äôt the same as having a theory that gravity is bending of space-time.,0

UgxP5zTxKlFsBxNYNih4AaABAg,"I am no expert on this but folding is not entirely random because it does not come into existence instantly. It starts small and gradually becomes larger. So initially the total number of possible shapes is very small.<br><br>Also new strings do not assemble in empty space with nothing around them. They are constantly being pushed around by the cytoplasm of the cell, and by other proteins in the vicinity of the new protein. The assembler proteins may themselves restrict the number of possible positions of the new chain as it self-assembles.<br><br>Also what keeps the new protein string from sticking to the assembler protein which itself is already a protein string?

I don&#39;t share the doom and gloom ideology that AI can only lead to humanity&#39;s destruction or widescale poverty. Political initiatives must be put in place to distribute technological innovations to all, so all can benefit from these inventions. I think these initiatives will be more challenging than actually creating the machines, given mankind&#39;s penchant for personal gain at the expense of social development and prosperity .

Actually, relatively low resolution is one of the drawbacks of Cryo-EM.<br>In the past, resolutions were very bad, but in the past few years, great development in algorithms used to 3D reconstitute the structure (the electron microscope gives you 2D projections of the structure, and you need to reconstitute the 3D structure out of these projections) and developments in the electron microscopes themselves have improved resolutions a great deal and made cryo-EM a very attractive approach (personally I believe along with predictive AI software, Cryo-EM is the future of structural biology). <br>On the other hand, the advantage of CryoEM is that it is much better at imaging large protein complex compared to X-Ray chlystarograhpy. You don&#39;t need to crystalize the protein (which is a pain in the ass), it is better at capturing biologically relevant structures because the proteins are in solution (before being flash-frozen) compared to the crystallized proteins, and Cryo-EM is much better at capturing protein dynamics (which is very relevant to the function)",1
UgzySSaK1xIJ7mjV9SR4AaABAg,"As the goal is 100% correctness the 90% could very well direct you in a wrong way. As long as there is no real A.I. which can emulate human thinking I don&#39;t think they help solve such abstract problems where you would actually search for an overall theory. Even a 99.9% correctness might be a randomly close result to a theory which must be formulated in such a different way, that you won&#39;t get nearer to it just by having ways to calculate an example very, very close to their prediction.<br>I would like to understanding protein if folding is important in research for &quot;real&quot; A.I.; i.e. simulating neuronal networks at the molecular(or atomic?) level . I think that was the path to go to solve real probable A.I. is/was going (with predictions it might be solved ~2025) I saw in a video ~5-10years ago (or maybe read somewhere).

Ugyao9tH_R-k16H8bkh4AaABAg,"Folding proteins appears to be a &quot;hideously difficult&quot; task for nature, too, it would seem. Cells cannot always &quot;expect&quot; proteins to fold into their proper confirmation, based solely on the amino acid sequence they assemble at the ribosome. In some cases, the intracellular machinery of employs the assistance of &quot;chaperone proteins&quot; (and even co-chaperones) to ensure protein conformation is physiologic. I wonder if this doesn&#39;t mean that AI won&#39;t be able to predict the tertiary or quaternary folding patterns in all proteins, based solely on the amino acid sequences?

There are a lot of proteins that are difficult to crystalize, such as membrane proteins, components of multi-subunit complexes and glycoproteins.

Ugx8tWZIijJ3RfgLeWx4AaABAg,"Current AI is all about pattern matching - take an unknown and see if it can be matched against a database of &#39;known&#39;. Unfortunately, therein lies it&#39;s Achilles Heel. If no match is found (mainly because the database is too small) then what do we do? Either we say &quot;match = 0&quot;, or, we introduce guesswork by returning a match percentage score e.g. 50% = half of the amino acid (AA) sequence has a match with one/more known sequences...but, there is a problem here - do we mean half the &#39;linear sequence&#39; is a match? (fewer returns, possibly higher quality), or do we mean multiple smaller sequences(&gt;1 AA) have matches, and when combined, equate to half the full sequence? (more returns, possibly poorer quality), but makes the algorithm look better than it is(!!).<br>Add into this mix is the fact that there will likely be single/more lengths of the AA chain that can be substituted with other specific AA&#39;s and not have a detrimental affect on the folded protein&#39;s full functionality. I&#39;d like to think that lots of work has already been done on the effects of AA substitution for known proteins.

UgygLdXe5wHSaZ_pU_x4AaABAg,"Methods for protein crystallography, and molecular simulations, was my field for many years.  I would like to add to your nice explanation why even with the good answers ,deep mind is not quite there; and it comes down to the precision of the answer, and the accuracy to the true answer.  If we take catalysts, much of the protein is a scaffold, a frame work to hold a few atoms in the right orientation, but with enough flexibility to enable a reaction to occur.  To understand these reactions and how the proteins work it is necessary that the atom positions are well determined, or we cannot tell if a reaction is  SN2 or Elimination - and without that knowledge we cannot determine how that protein fits into the metabolism.  The the fundamental process of solving the structure of a protein is therefore to discover the function of the protein and we can only do that if the atom positions are well enough defined, and the flexibility can be observed that allows understanding.<br>Therefore, protein folding must be good enough to discover that, and a score of 90% for the whole protein (or group of proteins) says nothing about the small number of critical atoms.  That problem will be solved at some stage, but I would say, not quite yet, as we still cannot replace the complex process of structure determination for folding programs even for quite simple  structures.",1

A good speaker is NOT afraid of the silent pause between sentences, and uses it profitably, instead of editing it out in post-production!<br><br>Take a look at the despicable PBS Eons and SciShow YouTube channels where they insult us with a constant stream of consciousness without any break at all, which leaves us feeling abused, and stupid, and not properly educated by whatever info they are trying (and failing) to present.<br><br>Thank you, Sabine.

There were attempts to determine the 3D structure in water, but as far as I know it never succeeded. 20 years ago, when I was a biochemistry student I had an idea how to find this out, but at that time there were no computer power to prove my idea. And no one can do that now as well. The A.I. algorithm is simple: imagine, each atom has some color  in light spectrum (quantum color), each atom vibrates and has its own color. Try to combine them all to get the white color. That color is a balance. When molecules become bigger, they need to combine their quantum colors to get the &quot;white&quot; again. It&#39;s impossible for the human mind. But A.I. could guess it. Humans only have to give it a formula of thinking. Like mathematics of more than 3 operators: -1+1=0. In three colors we have R+G+B=White. Also, we have 7 colors in rainbow, when you add 7 colors and still get the same white color.

Ugzj2IRASnhFS1EB3XB4AaABAg,"As someone who has dabbled in protein folding at foldit, I suspect that this AI approach will surely help a lot in finding protein shapes that depend on other proteins folding a similar way. But with your secondary and tertiary structure you&#39;ll sometimes get big surprises how it folds completely differently than you might expect. That said, I really hope that this AI or similar approach will eventually lead to a predictable and predictive way of getting to know protein structures from the DNA that we know. I don&#39;t think many people appreciate what a violent wobbling place a cell is. Things bump into each other all the time at high speed. Also the possible structure numbers posted might be a bit blown out IMO. The dna sequence and resulting protein chain puts somewhat of a limit on angles and tension in the resulting protein, at least in many positions of the structure. These are not obvious to many simulations though and might gain a lot from having an AI approach towards getting a protein that has a low backbone tension and gets close to the shape of the protein in reality.",0

Indeed, a protein is made amino acid after amino acid and is probably continuously shaped based on a lowest energy regime.

Also its known that proteins, when  gradually folding during synthesis, can interact with chaperon proteins to force a particular shape for the construction of the best &quot;final configuration&quot; to reach optimal activity.",0

The larger question is whether the approach can predict the structure of folds that have never been previously observed, unfortunately there is a diminishing number of those.

However, when a scientist of the stature of Andrei Lupas is impressed, reasonable people should pay attention. Even if the program could ‚Äúonly‚Äù predict the structures of known folds from sequence data alone, it would be incredibly valuable.

UgyU7qRZGZ2VB6HkBuB4AaABAg,nice vid.  for context (biochem bs learning ml in masters so def not an expert)   most proteins cant be solve by crystalogrpahy.  The really important parts of the protein are the IDR intrinsically disordered regions.  These are the lil bands that  that contect the large helices in the structures .  They dont take a crystallizable shape.   my understanding of crystalography is that it detects repeating structures.  indivudual protien collaesce into a crystal those structures that repeat are the ones you can calculate on.  IDR are dynamic.  they take many no repaeating shapes.  thus their structures are   hazy  to normal techniques.  IDR are super megaaaaaa level 9000 imp.  they are what allows proteins and their complexes to be dynamic.  so without giving intution on those then yeah. 100% not solved.   but it seems they have gotten verry verry good at solving the limited structures we have to train on.  I hope the model is interpretable and that it can give some intution on IDR cases but tbh the level of compute needed in these sims is ridiccccccuuulous.  like a de novo dim on a decent size  protein using rosetta (from what ive read)  requires a decent amount of time on a supercomputer to even be considered possible.  like you need a full NIH grant just to try..........  so doubt it makes much sense other than a black box method :(  hope this helps if u took the time to read it ;),0

If your target protein is produced in a culture of mammalian cells, then it is likely to be correctly folded but purifying it from all the thousands of proteins that mammalian cells also produce for their maintenance and metabolism can be a big challenge. If your protein is produced in a microbial expression system, then it is far less likely to be correctly folded.

One pretty important thing should not be forgotten: one key factor for protein folding (and also DNA structural changes B&lt;‚Äî&gt;Z) is the interaction of the protein (or DNA) with its solution (H2O networks stabilizing structure around polar protein groups) and of course the local concentration of ions (Na Cl). I remember that the crystallization of lysozyme happened in a small window of NaCl concentration and not below or above. A group at the MPI of BPC modeled those interactions with changes to the free energy W(1,2) between two particles 1 and 2 based on the changes to ion concentration in the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù.",0

Most natural history museums have the obligatory childish volcano model, nothing natural about life originating there, stupid.  Much less coded DNA or any of the &quot;evolutionary&quot; stages in between, nothing gets more complex. The big bang is fake science and proven false. Natural events produce nothing more complex than minerals, compounds that follow known laws because they must. But no natural process ever created life from nothing.

Duly liked and shared.<br>I&#39;ve been looking into the field a decade ago, before the attempts with AI.<br>We start with a protein codified by the linear, 2-D code of the DNA. As the ribosomes in the cell finish to assemble the protein, as soon this sequence of linked aminoacids leave the cell, within few milliseconds it folds into the required shape. This happen due to the complex interactions of electric fields  the molecule possesses.<br>My (informal) research consisted in locating, within the molecule, a number of electric dipoles, and elaborating a matrix which completely define the molecule.<br>Each dipole is a 3-D vector, and the matrix gets quite big quite fast; I just assumed this isn&#39;t a problem if a computer with the right power is used for the calculations.<br>Interesting how harmonic patterns emerges from the molecule electric field.<br>You rightly pointed out that AI require some initial pattern definitions in order to conduct a recognition.<br>This is why AI wouldn&#39;t initially work in the field of proteomics.

Sounds as if the machines will think for us now.<br>About he video, my years of Biology&#39;s student are well beyond me, but I think I  remember that there exist &quot;stevedore&quot; enzimes that guide the correct folding of the proteins, and the celular environment intervenes too, for example by the existent pH.

Ugzo3tD3jyQocieidtd4AaABAg,"I was surprised that you were not more critical of the claim that protein folding has been &quot;solved&quot;. While I think deepmind achieved something amazing, as far I understand, there is still work to do.<br><br>There is the missing 10% as mentioned in the video.<br><br>Many proteins fold into shapes that interact with molecules in dynamic ways. Helicases spin at 10,000 rpm and DNA polymerase moves strands of DNA around to help with the replication process. It&#39;s not clear how much useful information AlphaFold II could give about these kinds of proteins.<br><br><br>Sometimes proteins are modified after folding, for example insulin, where a strand folds, bonds with itself, and then some parts are removed. The AlphaFold II paper is not out yet, but it is almost certain that it cannot properly handle proteins which lose some amino acids, because exactly which parts are cleaved will depend on the other proteins in the environment.<br><br>AlphaFold II uses information about the evolved changes to proteins. It has also only ever been given a biologically functional protein as training data. This means it is unlikely to generalise outside the domain of biologically functional proteins. This is of course a huge and important domain, but it means that truly novel proteins would not be reliably folded by AlphaFold II. If AlphaFold II could predict the 3D shape of (more or less) any amino acid sequence, it could search for ones with binding pockets that fit transition states for chemical reactions that are useful to us, for example those used in industry, or the degradation of plastics.<br><br>AlphaFold II can (probably) only handle the 21 biologically common amino acids. If protein folding were truly &quot;solved&quot;, I would expect that more or less any possible amino acid would be acceptable.<br><br>My point is that while this is an amazing achievement, I think the claim that protein folding has been &quot;solved&quot; is highly misleading. Can AlphaFold II correctly predict the structure of alternating phenylalanine and cysteine residues? (Something that is likely very different from anything in its training data). Could AlphaFold II, paired with anything else available today, design a novel DNA polymerase?<br><br>I would call a problem &quot;solved&quot; when there was no longer anything significant to find out about it.",1

Ugw4DxYtk-1rO4qkeIB4AaABAg,"I have a Quora buddy who works for Deep Mind ... and though I won&#39;t go into details here to protect his privacy, met him  and his wife for an evening chat at Tokyo Japan&#39;s Google headquarters.  We spent at least half of our time talking about personnel problems at Google Japan ‚Äî the tendency for otherwise bright Japanese employees to aspire to a &#39;safe&#39; position in the corporate hierarchy, and then continue playing it safe to protect their position, thus minimizing risk-taking and innovation. ¬†Anyone who has played the publish-or-perish game of tenure in academia will recognize this all too well.<br><br>The above is merely institutional rigor-mortis, but it can deteriorate to enough corruption many institutions (mission drift) that quite a bit of research has been directed towards CWB (Counterproductive Work Behavior).  I have personal interest in this because about 6 years ago, I resigned in protest from a tenured position at a Japanese College because of institutional corruption, micro-managed racism, and dark-triad behavior.  But it can become even worse ... any A.I. enhancement of technological innovation can, and will, be weaponized. ¬†<br><br>From Mary Shelley&#39;s original &#39;Frankenstein&#39; to Michael Chrichton&#39;s &#39;Jurassic Park&#39;, thinkers have tried to warn us of the danger of fetishizing science and rationality itself ...  have tried to sound the same warning that Robert J. Oppenheimer uttered on seeing the first atomic blast.  We can not put the genie back into the bottle, and I am afraid it will not end well with us. ¬†<br><br>I really like Sabine&#39;s videos ‚Äî she is a great communicator ‚Äî  and have notifications turned on, but she seems more optimistic than myself that technical progress can be controlled  by collective moral progress. <br><br>Science as a heuristics may be the best hope we have.  But as described above, is a double edged sword.  Karl Popper is the go-to-guy for that warning.  And along with T.S. Kuhn, reminds us that scientists work for the corporate nation state, and have their own mortgages to pay, personal agendas to follow, and can be as mired in petty politics as any Wall Street Hedge Fund player.<br><br>Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr posited, as described by Noam Chomsky described in his 2010 Chapel Hill speech ... &#39;Human Intelligence and the Environment&#39;, that human intelligence may prove to be little more than a fatal mutation of a social primate, and he gave a good justification for that by pointing at the evolutionary arc of apex species.  Stephen Hawking put it a bit blunter ... &#39;Stupidity and greed will mark the end of the human race.&#39;  <br><br>I hope to see Sabina bring in a more moral framing of technical progress with references from the social sciences and liberal arts.  But once we go down that road, it is difficult to impossible to separate assumptions underlying science from some similar political presumptions that are not particularly corporate friendly.  We are already increasingly seeing the debate about this in determining whether social media such as ABC (Google/YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter) are platforms or publishers.

However, I don&#39;t think grumpiness is all there is to their concerns.<br><br>First off, black boxes like Alphafold can actually &quot;create&quot; their own datasets using categorizing functions that determine the best folds among an initial set, creating the next best set for a second step, and so on. Only the initial conditions really have to be made from actual data or, if you&#39;re very nostalgic about statistical physics, just turn the entire thing into an elaborate Monte Carlo and shoot in some random folds :P People give fancy names to things all the time, with machine learning being the next rebranding for &#39;automated optimization&#39;, where the very parameters of the model can be changed on demand by the algorithm itself.<br><br>In this case, this is a very &quot;safe&quot; application for machine learning, since if we choose bad categorizing algorithms we will find out (hopefully?) way before we inject proteins into humans, that the pretended miracle drug is actually a toxin.

UgzEAem8DNXTG_yNA6F4AaABAg,"As a biochemist who worked both with x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, a few comments: a) this is an excellent video, but i also never expected anything other than awesome from Sabine b) even if alpha fold performs less well for complexes or unusual folds, still it would be great if it could releive the burden of having to determine the structures of hundreds upon hundreds of similar proteins. This would free up valuable people and equipment to concentrate on the very unusual and complicated structures c) even if it doesn&#39;t revolutionize basic biochemistry, it can be of tremendous help to pharmaceutical research as they often work on relatively common folds (e.g. spike protein of Covid when you already know the spike structures of several other coronaviruses)",359

UgzTh5OfcvhZwwh3R5h4AaABAg,".. I like and appreciate your infomative, matter-of-fact, neutral views.",13
UgwNA793HO4sQFmhnmB4AaABAg,Interesting and clearly explained as always.  Many thanks.,4
UgyS74PuVRKnxU2Q1_14AaABAg,"Then unnerving thing about AIs is that they mostly work, but they always have edge cases where they fail, and don&#39;t know they&#39;ve failed. In fact they&#39;re often quite confident about their erroneous prediction, and fixing them is difficult. I imagine optical illusions are this phenomenon in humans, but we at least understand we&#39;re wrong.",3

UgwQiCVpn2wHW1vMZ6d4AaABAg,Sabine&#39;s social work in disseminating knowledge on such a wide range of scientific topics is invaluable.,70
Ugz8zd7qiSon-MelDYZ4AaABAg,Loved your string theory joke !!!!!,1

Ugxx4U5gHZgjgvcJDLh4AaABAg,Thanks. I really do enjoy my weekly fix of interesting stuff. I was actually wondering how they could test that claim of solving the protein folding problem - now I know.,5
Ugwdh64WvXUx3EsaSC14AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhJWAdZl-Ck&amp;t=568"">9:28</a> That is actually called machine learning, not artificial intelligence. And it&#39;s not entirely correct that it can only learn on existing data, AlphaGo learned without any data, governed by a set of rules which helped to determine whether one option was more preferable than the other. From evaluating those rules on sets of data from initial runs with a random values, the machine learned which one values are better for the task. That&#39;s is probably just how it learned folding too, since it&#39;s pretty easy to determine which resulting fold is better than the other...",7

UgzFzmWkApJJGUbM8C94AaABAg,Superb as always.  My lay-person understand is significantly enhanced!  I am thinking that the folding of engineered proteins might still be much harder to predict as they will not have run the gauntlet of natural selection.,3
