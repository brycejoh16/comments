UgxyAg4Yn85X8Ik0uCl4AaABAg,Two quick things...<br>This can be and most likely will be or already has been weaponized.<br>And was the mask really necessary? Lol.,0
UgxXb9EpgPAYy5RW0WJ4AaABAg,Can we now design a protein(nanomachine) that will take apart CO2 and make from it graphene and oxygen?,0
UgymM7Bg7EgO6ZX3-ih4AaABAg,Understanding protein folding will revolutionize biology!,0
UgzowqdGkf83WrcdQDF4AaABAg,the mask is useless doctor?,0
Ugx9JgqIFyVkpogckDZ4AaABAg,Pros: Defeating prion disease. Cons: Nasty runaway nano plumes.,3
Ugwy3MG9PMsa6nQsuMV4AaABAg,Every living organism should be RECLASSIFIED according to their DNA and 3-D (folding) protein structures.  And using AI a NEW classification of living life should be done.  Let the AI independently come up with the new classification of life according to DNA and 3-D (folding) protein structures.,0
UgxALRt_ZtBtpKqtEdx4AaABAg,The applications of this feat in medicine are seemingly limitless. Is Alpha2 limited to solving tertiary confirmation folding patterns or also quaternary?,0
UgzhafzoauNx_B-QRrp4AaABAg,The ultimate goal is to control all chemical reactions in the cell through a computer. Any item can be grown in the future. (curing diseases is just the beginning) And the future is nature&#39;s complete safe programming,1
