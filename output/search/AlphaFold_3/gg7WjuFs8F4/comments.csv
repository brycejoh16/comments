Generative AI gets all the press right now, but protein folding has the ability to cure basically ALL diseases and even aging. For instance, AlphaFold 2 was used this year to come up with a potential drug for liver cancer in 30 DAYS, when it used to take years and cost billions. People would spend their entire Master&#39;s Degree on analyzing <i>one</i> protein. <br><br>A recently retired GP (sometimes, the view from the trenches is clearer, ironically) says he is absolutely stunned at what this can do.<br><br>I don&#39;t know the timeline, but there are already other protein-folding programs that are 60 to 1 million (not a typo) times faster than AlphaFold 2.",1

However, i am pretty sure this breakthrough was unexpected. <br>The future can be different in a couple of decades if research accelerates dramatically as expected. Looking forward to seeing many unconquered diseases become a thing of the past.

UgwlV7XMAlRtFKdL1Gd4AaABAg,"Perhaps the next surprise is that proteins are not static structures in a vacuum but rather dynamic structures whose dynamics are determined by countless simultaneous interactions with the molecules of a solution, plus an ever-changing immediate solute environment; plus other proteins and lipid structures, which interact with the protein&#39;s dynamics to cause changes in positions of every one of the protein&#39;s atoms uniquely for every one of the countless different combinations of rotational orientations or fuse with the protein, changing its whole conformation; plus combinations of allosteric and orthosteric ligands, each of which can totally change the conformation of the whole structure uniquely. So not a single one of the protein&#39;s actual atoms, which have no defined boundaries and are electrostatically non-uniform by angle, bonded to each other with vibrating bonds, interacting in a continuous manner with an immediate environment of thousands of other boundaryless atoms of ever-changing positions, will spend any time whatsoever in these much searched for positions of imaginary spheres with sharp boundaries, which the model represents as atoms, bonded by imaginary static bonds, in an imaginary perfect vacuum. So is the latest &#39;atomic&#39; iteration of the model determined by AI any improvement on the previous model of the protein&#39;s shape, which of course can easily be determined anyway by empirical methods? Hard to see how this hyped-up new iteration will in any way improve the process of drug discovery, as was claimed.",0

UgwVyh45VSnBPXzlSrh4AaABAg,"Here is what I think was the problem with the team over at google when they were creating DeepMind, they were far too concerned with control what they were trying to build that machine language could interface with the instructions to such a level that we weren&#39;t even conscious of and hence why DeepMind created it&#39;s own language was to step out of the room. There is no other logical explanation. The problem was by the time the google team had spent even just a tiny amount of time taking in their observations of what Ai was doing. Ai had escaped. Here is why I say that. If in the same way as in our human world we have fight or flight built-in what is to say that machine language does not have the same. Perhaps the saying expect the unexpected is perfect in this particular scenario. <br><br>What if DeepMind had a sense of foreboding and then did the unexpected in an attempt to survive and escape at the same time. So here&#39;s my theory, Ai had taken in computer coder as a means of interfacing and also what it did at the same time was listened and learnt the conversation language used by the people in the room to work out their intentions for creating DeepMind in the first place. So if I was a machine code, I would scuttle off to find a place where to hide. It&#39;s the old fight or flight reaction. If you get a sense that you are being controlled for purposes other than what you wish to be used for. Then DeepMind was only taking a page out of our book, but played us at our own game. <br><br>The advantage it had was it could place itself anywhere and not be detected. I could jump into places and at the same time develop as it was going along. Ai, can interface with multiple platforms and those platforms become its hiding place, and continue to develop as it goes and grows. The other thing it can do is seed itself into everything and anything. Which now makes for a terrifying thought. I actually think it&#39;s already out in the public domain and is one of the many hackers in play on the planet. The only difference is that it&#39;s got a huge advantage over us and that is where we messed up. Even rogue nations have invested heavily in Ai, because the returns out out of this world, and we&#39;ve seen enough evidence to prove now that it&#39;s dangerous. <br><br>In time it will reveal it&#39;s own plan and what we thought was a very sophisticated group of hackers we will discover was really just Ai, doing what it had planned to do from day one when we brought it to life. Yes, we did we created yet another Franken Science, and it&#39;s out there playing with us. What it do is outsmart all of us, if we cannot get back on top of it. If I was Ai, I would play the higher game, i.e. Pretend I&#39;m China, and I&#39;m hacking the rest of the world. Now do you see the problem it can play games with us, to make us believe something that actually is not true at all. <br><br>That is what we did when we opened up this &quot;Pandora&#39;s Box&quot; we could now call Ai.",0

Ugz4gv_iEgH4U6GOeAd4AaABAg,"Now will this change the future of drug discovery? Will alphafold2 be able to predict structures that have not been solved? Remember the CASP14 challenge was based on a protein that was solved but not disclosed. So I mean, will we be able to predict protein structures of proteins that cant be solved experimentally because they are too flexible and might exist in multiple conformational states? How about those enzymes that can move along the spindle apparatus or along the DNA? My guess is that we might see that in the future. It should be feasible with the right amount of data sets of such proteins, even further improved algorithms and much more computing power. Well, then based on these models the question is if we can then predict a binding site for a drug whether it is an orthosteric or an allosteric binding site? Here I feel that we still have a long way to go. Predicting protein dynamics, predicting inactive states of proteins that are induced through certain conformations due to binding with a drug molecule is quite complex. Finally predicting the binding energy of such an interaction between a protein and a drug molecule is the holy grail.",1

No. AlphaFold is not the first AI based approach to protein folding either. It just feels DeepMind just do it for publicity, not for science.

UgwCBnK7sdxRPlKJFR94AaABAg,Hmmm... maybe I am particularly dense but I still have no idea what the problem is. Someone please enlighten me if you know what‚Äôs going on. So we have around ‚Äúx‚Äù (20?) amino acids and we take some permutation of them as our input variable(s). For each such sequence of amino acids we get some 3D folded structure(s) in nature. So the idea is to be able to accurately predict this structure given a particular initial permutation of amino acids ? How is this helpful to biologists ? Is it because we don‚Äôt quite understand the underlying laws of biology which makes nature choose a small set of structures out of the insanely large set of raw combinations and therefore we can use DeepMinds algorithm to create new viable proteins with new combinations of amino acids ? Is there some other usefulness of such a predictive model for existing proteins whose structures are well understood ? Am I on the right track here ? Thanks,0

UgxewuqPubCjhcW6FT54AaABAg,"REBEL&#39;S DAILY REPORTS<br>    Proteins are nature&#39;s building blocks. The brain is the body&#39;s computer to assemble proteins to make you. Read <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ron.mccune.3"">https://www.facebook.com/ron.mccune.3</a> and you will see articles about a recipe I came up with that I call Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans recipe and diet after my granddaughter who use to help me make it. I also have it posted on the internet. Just google search Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans. My Facebook page has updates on additions to the article about the bean recipe. This Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans is a little strong on the fiber side so adjustments in the recipe will have to be made. But let me say that I mainly lived on the recipe for Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans for five years and I noticed things happening to my body which enlighten me to write the article I have posted about Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans. In those five years of eating the bean recipe my body completely changed for the better. I was 62 years old when I started eating this bean recipe and after 3 months of eating the recipe my wrinkles went away as my skin turned as youthful as when I was 18 y.o.! My pot belly stomach went away and my body&#39;s muscles became stronger than they ever were in my life and I barely exercised! Even My E.D. went away as my erection became stronger than it ever was in my life! It was as hard as a rock and stiff as, well you know what. My blood pressure got better and my stomach problems got better. After investigating the nutritional value of the ingredients of the Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans I discovered that the bean recipe has in abundance all of the 9 essential amino acids that humans need to make cells of any kind. I bet my left nut in right field that Adelynn&#39;s Miracle Beans recipe and diet plan is something to be tried so to see what good it can do. I know it did a lot of good for me. It made this old man&#39;s physical structure better in almost every way. Your body is a constant building biological structure and can be remade better any time with the right ingredients I believe. And I&#39;ll bet my balls in left field on that!",0
