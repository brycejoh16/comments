These companies like OpenAI seem to be like the people determining how much to open/close the gates of the dam to the public. AI is closed because of interference from government agencies. Sam can&#39;t say this or he actually swallow whatever the spy/security handlers tell him about the world, or they just outright threatened him.<br><br>Having true AI out in the open would destroy entire industries overnight, including large parts of the government.

UgyEjN_AYpZXhJxi2tB4AaABAg,OpenAI used to operate like a disruptive startup. They have no incentive to do so anymore. Opensource will catch up and the AI arms race will create alot of new opportunities. Sam tried to monopolize the AI LLM/multimodal space for as long as possible and build partnerships with big companies that dominate in their respective area&#39;s. These big companies are now building their own AI divisions forcing Openai to change strategy and slow down roll out of features. Even lowering expectations for future updates,0

Ugx51Jc2ksgFDZPao8F4AaABAg,"Big mistake to bring on Sam Altman, I watch this show to stimulate the thought process surrounding different innovative and transformative technology. Predictably, Sam rambled on and provided zero insight because he is completely driven by greed and in the process volunteers nothing that does not further his goals. Zero credibility.<br><br>More importantly why are you guys getting so badly sucked into the lmm space? Why is nobody clearly explaining that the language models have zero intelligence, absolutely zero, nor do they generate anything but linguistic content. LMMs are glorified webcrawlers, the only innovation really here is that they can put the search results together into coherent linguistic tokens that are easily understood by humans. You guys push this like a new groundbreaking era. It is not. Nothing that is currently out there, nothing that has even been introduced or marketed features any sort of reason. Let me give you an example: the Microsoft ai assistant copilot does nothing else than understand instructions given and then makes deterministic decisions, all completely pre-programmed. Having worked in the RE and Transformer space in the very early days, I have to say I am extremely unimpressed with the progress made thus far in the several years post the transformer introduction. My bet is that something much more transformational lies in the vaults of several of tech companies but they hold back and suck every last penny out of consumers with the currently rather disappointing ai infused products. <br><br>How some of you sucked up to Sam was quite frankly embarrassing. I liked the earlier shows because the content was refreshing and at times challenging. Can we expect in every upcoming show blowjobs for tech executives who just shower us with their marketing gibberish? And it feels like talk about cash cash cash is completely taking over the rest of the show. Please get back to exploring the many angles of transformative technology that is currently being introduced, all else is taking away value added.",1

UgzUSF-xGCEcJusLO1d4AaABAg,"Another good discussion.  The conversation about AI regulation lacks imagination.  It won&#39;t just be the USA or SV firms running AI.  Russia will get it.  China will have it.  North Korea and Iran, and many smaller states with dictators will make their own.  Just imagine what Pinochet would have done with ChatGPT 4 in Chile, Salazar in Portugal, Franco in Spain.  Even without reasoning capacity, the current state of LLM AI offers authoritarians tremendous power, and that has to be regulated to protect people and democracy.  Every new technology for good becomes a new weapon of war.  Every information tool is used to inspire and inform and control and subjugate.  That&#39;s not a theory.  That&#39;s history.",0

Ugyj5ua--t9RqACho8V4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSM0xd8xHUM&amp;t=4818"">1:20:18</a> I have done alot of work for Apple so here goes a couple of thoughts. They are very rigid and layered in terms of hierarchies regarding the creative. And super careful about their own brand (and honestly, too big) to innovate anymore. All of these keynotes look exactly the same and they are super boring and expected. Regarding the ad, the concept is to compress all of those things into the iPad but they changed the script so it would fit better what they filmed. Crushing creative tools did not resonate, principally given we are in an AI race and their user base is scared. The compression concept is good and could have been done in a myriad of ways but you have now tons of agency people look after their own portfolios and building this whole thing for real is a much better piece than something that could have communicated the concept more elegantly and simply. I also think they are struggling to innovate because they are big and slow and there are too many working on the same thing. It&#39;s also the reason the shows suck. The biggest sign that there is something wrong with the system at Apple as a company is that Siri in its current state is still active in my phone.",0

Subsequently, the U.S.A used this lie as justification for invading Iraq and murdered large number of innocent civilians. Joseph Goebbels was the Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany employed a propaganda strategy: repeating a lie a thousand times until it became accepted as truth. The United States exhibits comparable levels of moral wrongdoing to Nazi Germany, if not surpassing them. Currently, the United States is providing weapons to kill large numbers of innocent civilian in Gaza. At least 33,899 Palestinians has been killed since 7 October 2023 with American weapons. Despite Adolf Hitler&#39;s demise, numerous Nazis relocated from Germany to various destinations. Some held positions within the government, while others found roles in the private sector, such as media companies.

At the time, I remember thinking it was a plan to take over the company; first create a scenario to get fired then stage a coup against a weak/incompetent board with financially motivated employees/team members and get reinstated with more control than before. Win by losing. I&#39;m glad he got the chance to discuss what really happened. I find the subject of generated intelligence fascinating. However, I lost interest, put Sam Altman and all related subject material in the Meh file. Generated intelligence, whether AI, AGI, LLMs etc. will be like every other technology. It will start out with noble intent. It will end up manipulated for personal profit and military uses that will kill millions before being regulated out of existence. It still think it is quite likely AGI will slowly go insane. If it is put on a mobile app, multiple millions of users could put it under enormous stress or it could be exposed to a cyber attack. If humans can go insane from unrelenting stress and confusion, AGI can suffer the same fate.

UgzY17v1yKnElpMccsN4AaABAg,"‚ÄúEveryone has a home, everyone has Apple TV‚Äù, sorry gents but you slipped up on your prol speak. <br>I have never been an Apple / Steve Jobs fanboy, but I can recall over 35 years ago trying to convince the engineering company I worked for to get the NeXT computer, and the NeXTSTEP OS,  that Jobs had created after he left Apple around 1985. The NeXT computer ultimately didn‚Äôt hit escape velocity, but its legacy transformed into parts of macOS and although many people know Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, few know he did it on a NeXT cube. The point is many parts of Apple‚Äôs and Jobs so called flops were ultimately incorporated into the successful products they are known for. Every sports team has a dry spell, and perhaps Apple is having one now, but they do have the knack for surprising us just at the point we are saying they have become stale and run out of ideas. I‚Äôm curiously watching the iPad Pro M4 and iOS 18 and wondering if they have an AI surprise that will bring in another Apple paradigm shift. Time will tell‚Ä¶",0

UgzW2urvBpkW7FA705R4AaABAg,"Great episode, everyone! <br>While I found it challenging to watch and listen to Chamath talking, due to his recent political opinions‚Äîwhich I believe are unethical and uninformed‚Äî but I made it to the end!",1
UgwmoQ_0hNqzgUkmjVd4AaABAg,He‚Äôs confirmed he‚Äôs really  not an expert in AI. He‚Äôs a mediocre cheerleader exec making slow poor decisions that turned ‚ÄúopenAI‚Äù closed. Open source will consign him to history dustbin.,4
UgyWkPi4CgXkbO1Jbhd4AaABAg,The likelihood this dude did what his sister says he did is extremely high.,32
Ugx_Z12MqRseA0gfOf14AaABAg,I think Sam speaks more to confuse than to clarify,1026

UgxQNQat5py5bB1_pC94AaABAg,"Interviews with Altman are so boring, no new information or context with anything and he comes off so self-righteous",271
UgzijHyMzqkyxVO89ix4AaABAg,"He is not trustworthy. He took something that was supposed to be open and closed it for his own profit and power. He can talk cap about wanting to make the world better all he wants. But actions speak louder them words, buddy!",24

UgzLP9KcP65aIhy085t4AaABAg,"What is the deal? 11 minutes in and the hard questions are posed very softly, Sam gives snowball answers, and no one is pressing him for an honest statement.
