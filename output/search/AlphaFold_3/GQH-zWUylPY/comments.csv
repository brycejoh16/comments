UgxS0jB4dMrHof2JcJt4AaABAg,Watching this as a 50 year old GenXer...confirms that I totally dont give a fuck that young people didn&#39;t learn cursive.   Ya&#39;ll know code. And code jargon. Communication tools orders of magnitude more powerful.,0

UgyJEbasL-QoUh9oAEt4AaABAg,can you do the same for alphafold 2 or they follow the same steps?,1
UgxSU-fv2KMnmOGZ4z94AaABAg,"u dont know anything, I feel like you need to learn more then come on youtube to show ur disgusting hairshade, ur just making fun of yourself..",0
Ugy2QP3PZ6DyRpwYMQV4AaABAg,"Siraj, we cannot use our own sequence to predict the structures using AlphaFold, as per the GitHub website data and the alphafold website. So, how you did it?",3
UgzLLGYJ4FqulhR0q714AaABAg,"Wow, I wonder how the protein folding structre is for  covid-19 could you upload a video on that!",1
Ugyk13qa9HCtaKcLaRp4AaABAg,This is a huge breakthrough in biology. <br>But saying that it will replace biochemists is like saying that a stat. analysis software will replace mathematicians. AI will play a huge role in future scientific research but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it will make biochemists useless.,0

UgwQeKz4Q8hovKRF7K54AaABAg,"I see proteins are built using advanced microscopic additive manufacturing processes and now alphafold has given us the power to do what nature took a long time to develop.

Ugze-BhI7aIst82p6GF4AaABAg,we need an updated video,1
UgyutBYljJCebu5EYAp4AaABAg,update it!,1
UgzqmuD-1ojcS4b67Uh4AaABAg,"Sorry, but the original Alphafold implementation is a dead-end. Some others were made:<br>1- ProSPr (<a href=""http://github.com/dellacortelab/prospr)"">github.com/dellacortelab/prospr)</a><br>2- Alphafold_pytorch (<a href=""http://github.com/Urinx/alphafold_pytorch)"">github.com/Urinx/alphafold_pytorch)</a><br>A paper on the first is in bioRxiv since November. I would rather focus on this one.",0

Ugy3vdORakMwIB9jZkh4AaABAg,What gives you the confidence to still go on with your bullshit? Never seen a more shameless human being,0
UgyQdGGMwGqOXjhlp_14AaABAg,"Dude, THANK YOU. This is a great explanation! But also, the AlphaFold code available says it can&#39;t be used to predict structures outside of the CASP13 dataset. Does this mean you actually can&#39;t input your own sequence of interest, or just that accuracy cannot be ensured with other sequences?",18
UgwiP7l09jQZPRz60wt4AaABAg,Code chor,1
Ugy3KD98Y6pyDX2b_P14AaABAg,You are chor..,1
UgyvHQqIvf6blEW3INJ4AaABAg,what if you accepted you don&#39;t know machine learning and AI you talk so much about.<br>Go on to take a break and then coming back after a year or so with strong knowledge of concepts.<br>just a recommend though i know u r a YouTuber and not a AI teacher in any way.,7
Ugzijp2d8Y9_lIbex_54AaABAg,It sounds like Alphafold doesn&#39;t take into account post-translational modifications and chaperones.,0

UgwzuQjkIXNudbFRRLZ4AaABAg,Siraj now have they solved the protein folding problem or they are just bluffing,0
Ugw43NK_Et08W71pki54AaABAg,Can you use this code to predict new protein structures? Where do you put the file with the sequence you want to predicted? Can you visualize using PyMOL?,3
