UgwC1Dhxfm4gxLunX8x4AaABAg,"Robert Zwanzig, a premier figure in Statistical Mechanics, used simple models to illustrate the speed of protein folding. He basically one of the fathers of modern statistical physics. Along with JW Gibbs, JG Kirkwood, PG Wolynes,  D Chandler etc, etc. AlphaFold predicts the structure, but is not in the business of predicting the dynamics of the fold. There is a gigantic volume of work by leaders in stat mech unknown to people in &quot;Computer Science&quot;. Speaking of which, a large team appears to have worked on AlphaFold,  the lead of which was John Jumper, who did his Ph.D on protein folding under another prominent stat mech professor, Karl Freed from U Chicago. What I am trying to convey is the scope of this is beyond: Alphafold is &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;, who with nothing less than a pen an paper, could convey grand ideas with the simplest of models, and that is true genius. Jumping back today,  Frank Noe from Germany is perhaps the best able to bridge both worlds at this moment and communicate connections from different field.  All best.<br><br>As a side note JW Gibbs was an incredible American scientist in the 1800s who created much of the foundations/machinery  of statistical mechanics that is used today. Just looking at his &quot;Elementary principles of statistical mechanics&quot; published in 1902 is awe inspiring. He is probably one of the least known, appreciated American physicists but hugely influential to developments in 20th century.",0

Ugy55BAMwm67DXR1jpp4AaABAg,"@LexFridman. Thank you for this fascinating overview.  You state &quot;proteins are the building blocks of eukaryotes.&quot;  Considering their evolutionary significance, I think it&#39;s vital to mention ALL cellular forms of life (on Earth) use amino acids, which of course includes the prokaryotes (Archaea and bacteria).  Acellular, infectious agents include viruses and PRIONS. Viruses are essentially nucleic acids encased in proteins.  Proteinaceous Infectious agents (PRIONS) are intriguing, transmissible proteins that cause disease via perpetuation of misfolding (eg. Scrapie, BSE, CJD, and nvCJD).<br><br>Prokaryotes and viruses have coevolved over several billion years and humans are but a speck on the evolutionary time scale compared to them.  Every now and then a thing called a pandemic happens and remind us of that fact.  I&#39;m in awe of the advances in science has made in combatting pathogens and to gain insight into the human microbiome. Machine-based learning not-withstanding, will we benefit from such advances in the future if we continue to experience the politically-charged, anti-science, anti-intellectual climate?  I&#39;d like to remain optimistic but realistic.  We can solve humongous issues when we work together in an evidenced-based manner but such cooperation seems less likely in a human-centric world mired in inequity and power struggles.   As usual, it will come down to how we use the technology and who controls it.  Powerful either way.",0

UgzV2oul8saM1LlK-aB4AaABAg,"A few points: (1) There&#39;s a still a long way to go before the protein structure prediction problem is &quot;solved&quot;, let alone protein folding. Though AF2 is the undisputed champion *at the moment*. (2) The 2013 Nobel in Chemistry for &quot;multiscale modelling of complex chemical systems&quot; was the one for protein folding simulations and I doubt they&#39;ll do just another in Chemistry without AF2 models being used for something that is deserving of a Nobel in and of itself; and (3) it is John Moult/CASP that really deserves the Nobel, not the methods that are doing well at this moment. Prior to CASP things were a mess for decades until John put in his energy to create this challenge and the field improved over the years. (I am biased but this is my view.)",0
UgwKOypV-wpuuPUfjH94AaABAg,"Quote unquote is right, because not only have they not solved the problem, they haven&#39;t even tried to address it.  This is not really such a big advancement in structural biology.  There are many shortsighted people, even in the CASP community that have misconstrued the protein solving problem as merely being able to predict how the proteins will fold from their sequence alone.  This is not really the spirit of the problem though and was not really the difficult part of the problem.  The entire difficulty of the problem was to make the prediction essentially &quot;from first principles.&quot;  That is, can you predict the folding based on the physical properties of those component molecules (molecular force fields), as is done in de novo molecular dynamics.  The entire interesting part of the problem is that this is difficult and that many proteins may in fact NOT fold to their &quot;native&quot; conformations simply by being placed in water.  There are many proteins that fold in specialized biological environments such as within other proteins (chaperonins), etc...  Busting out the big correlation machine and utilizing the huge built up protein structure databases is really not that interesting and tells us pretty much zero new information about the folding process.  Yes, it may be useful to save time in drug design (maybe... currently most drugs are small molecules anyway....) eventually and still be useful, but entire point of the protein folding problem seems to have gone well over their heads.  And I gladly accuse those in the community that should know better of this publicity stunt as well.  Baker should be canned as he&#39;s either acting as a total shill or the problem is well over his head and he isn&#39;t capable of teaching the subject matter.   I&#39;m frankly shocked by how little opposition has been expressed to DeepMind&#39;s silly crowing of victory.  This vast oversimplification also ignore very obvious things, like disordered proteins that don&#39;t even fold in the first place, and that the mapping to a 3D structure isn&#39;t really 1:1, not even close as most proteins have quite a bit of flexibility in their structure so what is reported are averages.  Levinthal&#39;s paradox isn&#39;t an actual paradox, just a pseudo-paradox, and the number of ways you&#39;re quoting to fold is based on either a particular protein or an average, as the folding possibilities will depend on the length of the protein... in reality many of these conformations are not energetically feasible though (i.e. you pretty much couldn&#39;t reach them without tearing the molecule apart and would require huge Gibb&#39;s free energy) so the real number of potential states is far far fewer.  This is all highly unlikely to help solve misfolding diseases in any significant way because it offers 0 additional insight into the folding process, so what went wrong and why it went wrong are things the models don&#39;t even begin to address.  I recently read a paper where they evaluated attention from BERT models for the same task and no, the attention isn&#39;t really showing anything useful either, it mostly just confirms the things the model was trained on.  There&#39;s a lot of speculation on what it will be good for because there are few actual use cases for this right now.  Even when it comes to protein design, the most difficult part there is actually producing the protein, which you have to do anyway.  DeepMind might cut down the time on that, which would be nice, but that&#39;s certainly not the level of achievement that Alpha Fold has been hyped as.  They&#39;re not going to really help that much on the physics based simulation front either, those models are CPU/GPU constrained rather than input model constrained per se and are actually the models that are at the root of the protein folding problem in the first place, that these models often do not produce the folded structures that are observed.  Then again, we don&#39;t strictly know that the observed X-ray crystallography structure even are how these proteins appear in vivo, they quite likely are not in many cases since many non-physiological steps are taken to obtain those crystals (and obviously they wouldn&#39;t be functional in your body while crystallized).  So the fact that AlphaFold is great at reproducing folds that we would expect from crystallography doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s really doing a good job at prediction of the actual folding.  Just the fact that all of these potential issues are glossed over/totally ignored and AlphaFold doesn&#39;t discuss them openly and honestly in order to bask in as much glory as possible is incredibly irritating.  They way overhyped their SCII AI, AlphaStar, as well...  there they started off choosing that game because of problems like imperfect information... and ended up building AI that won games chiefly on strong mechanics rather than good decision making...  In both cases what they have actually achieved is not how they have presented their achievements.",0

To make a car drive automatically doesn‚Äôt answer any fundamental questions of physics, chemistry or biology, but the question of how proteins fold has been a long standing question in science.

A class of protein notorious for being difficult to work with are membrane proteins. These could take months or years to prepare. Then the challenge is to coax the protein to crystallise.

Ugya9A1SoRpdDjArIIN4AaABAg,"X-ray crystallography, can take a year it can take many years but often the hardest part is growing the crystals once you have a good Crystal its a matter of days to get a structure. Also getting a structure doesn&#39;t cost us even close to that much, atleast using my universities laser. Additionally, many people are doing cryo EM now, which can give you a high res structure in a matter of 2-3 weeks max. Yes both methods are slower than in silco but in vitro structures will always have to be collected because sometimes these algorithms are WAY off. This doesn&#39;t get rid of the need for cryo or x-ray crystallography but it will allow researchers to get a good idea of what their protein should look like much quicker in silico. Which can help in the decision making process for protein engineers.<br><br>If they keep up the great work they probably will solve the problem within the next 2-4 years, but they haven&#39;t done it yet.",1

In reality there are really only 20 naturally occurring proteinogenic amino acids since Selenocysteine which is homologous to cysteine replaces a Sulfur atom with Selenium and is only found in about 50 proteins. X-ray crystallography will still be around where there is a need to solve more complex protein structures where subdomains exist or to understand how small molecule drugs bind to protein targets. Maybe that will be the next breakthrough but a much tougher problem since there is not a big training set for AI.

UgyF6KcvCagXA0Q-0Jl4AaABAg,"Just one thing about misfolding. Misfolding are of not too big interest to most molecular biologists. It does play a role in some diseases, but most of diseases are caused by other things. Biologists just want to know the structure to know how it interacts with other molecular machinery, be it healthy or unhealthy parts, or in pathogens. The 3D structure is just useful for many things, be it progressing knowledge, drug design, etc. Also a lot of proteins are composed of more than just amino acids. They can have so called post-translation modifications (happens after translation or during), that do include extra attached groups, be it non-amino acids, or short peptide groups, or sometimes non-peptide groups (called cofactors or prostethic groups), thus forming a bit branching strcture (kind of tree in CS), or be composed of multiple sub-units of the same or different type, that together create some weird complexes. All of them determine 3D structure, stability, folding and function. So the complexity is actually way higher than one would thing just by looking at the sequence. I don&#39;t belive sequence itself fully describe the protein. It does in many cases, but not always. Anyhow, biologists just want to know the structure of correctly folded protein for many reasons. Study of misfolding is rather niche, but of course important to some stuff, and progressing knolwedge of the folding process itself. Also I think the 10^143 figure, is just deceptive. It is not like nature tries all the combinations. Proteins are mosly synthetized in sequential process, one amino acid at the time, not in parallel, so obviously, the folding process is mostly incremental, and determined or rather influenced by the enzymes that do the synthesis - folding happens during synthesis naturally. It is like saying air molecules in the room I am in can be in one of 10^100000000000000000000000000000000 possible configurations, but it always finds the energy minimum and spreads uniformly. Or that there might be 10^1000000 books possible, yet humans, always write ones that do have a structure and sense and can be parsed. It silly to even mention this paradox, because it is not a paradox.",1

UgwLLHAWR7zyF8VwOsZ4AaABAg,"This is a great video with a useful insight into how DeepMind came to win CASP. As a biochemist and bioinformatician who has been part of the effort to &quot;solve the protein folding&quot; problem I would say that strictly speaking the problem has not actually been solved. I say this because the research many people focused on was &quot;how do proteins fold into specific configurations?&quot; The DeepMind solution does NOT answer that question. There is no insight into the biophysical rules that guide the folding. And the reason that research has centred specifically on understanding &quot;how&quot; is because the answer to THAT question gives answers in BOTH directions of the problem. DeepMind can go from sequence to structure, but it cannot go from structure to sequence (&quot;I want a protein that has this structure - what sequence gives me that?&quot;).<br><br>Of course, with further AI and computing power, it is possible to start from a structure that has a similar form to what you wish to create and therefore it is just a matter of applying a genetic algorithm  which does what it was created to mimic, to go through the combinations until the target structure is reached. But still, it isn&#39;t &quot;understanding&quot;, it is just doing.<br><br>The other thing I would say that DeepMind does not do is offer insight into diseases caused by misfolded proteins. And to be specific here, a misfolded protein is a protein that has not folded into the configuration that its sequence predicts to fold into, usually because of unusual factors within the folding environment. DeepMind can only go from sequence to structure. It cannot provide any information about the folding process or influences of the folding environment. For diseases where &quot;misfolding&quot; is due to sequence mutations strictly speaking the protein is folding correctly, just not the same as the native sequence. For these mutated sequences, yes, DeepMind will help.<br><br>I have said for a long time that the problem of protein structure prediction would be broken by the brute force of AI. But the protein folding problem still exists.",0
UgySgTpIl6DdZ8nDMxF4AaABAg,"An underlying notion in microbiology is that structure begets function. There is an charge and distance character to each of the amino acids that create &quot;activity sites&quot; for physical or chemical reactions to occur. Thus the order of amino acids is the structure, and that determines the function. When I say order of amino acids, we can think about that in two ways. First, is the linear order of the amino acids as they come off the assembly line so-to-speak. Second, and far more important, is how this linear order conforms in the 3d space- hence folding. One key characteristic of amino acids is their tendency to orient with or against water, hydrophilic (with) or hydrophobic (against). The space where proteins is fold is all water, generally, and therefore the hydrophobic amino acids must congregate to reduce their free energy. This is generally what protein folding in the 3-d space comes down to. All of this is to say that if we can understand how a protein will fold, we can better determine it&#39;s function.<br><br>What makes this breakthrough so incredible is that once we have quick method for generating structures, we can fill in the functional landscape. This allows use to scan the breadth of protein function for attributes we deem useful, and apply them how we see fit. Now comes in the necessity of big data management and machine learning techniques- which I know far less about. It&#39;s an exciting, and utterly confusing, world we have going.",0

UgwYsSKo39MVx1cJrrd4AaABAg,"Protein-Complex formation is quite an interesting thing, however it is also a lot more complex than what AlphaFold is currently doing. Rearrangements in proteins are a minute sequence of movements which are hard to model. On top of that, there are several possible structures of proteins that are equally true. Just for an example, the spike protein of viruses (take SARS-CoV-2 as an example) undergoes a vast rearrangement from its pre-fusion form to its fused form where the innere helices extend into the cell membrane of the host. But what you cannot model and what AlphaFold and AI cannot predict - so far - are the intermediate steps. For me working in the field of bioinformatics and simulation of proteins the AI approach solves a lot of questions but also leaves some, at least for me, more important questions unanswered. AlphaFold cannot give an answer to the underlying mechanisms of protein folding but gives a solution to the folding problem. However, there are complementary methods like molecular dynamics simulations that can answer some of these questions. In the end, I am really stoked about AlphaFold 2.0!",0

All CASP participants know this performance was inevitable, and we would achieve it merely as a result of improved silicon and the combining of techniques featured in the previous year&#39;s conference. As a biochemist, I am apprehensive about the empirical rigor we see with deep learning research in general. DeepMind has always been full of hype while hush hush on details in a way that makes it difficult for actual scientists to appreciate. 87% is impressive, but frankly, this does nothing to quell my skepticism (or the rest of research community&#39;s, for that matter). Additionally, AlphaFold is clearly intended to become a commercial product, which is why DeepMind doesn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about establishing their rigor within the literature. It only requires a vague semblance of academic authority to sell to Big Pharma.<br>This was a fun and well-explained video, but Lex, as a fellow deep learning researcher, your unmitigated optimism w.r.t.

This all giving room to different thermodynamic scenarios for the folding of each generated part of the protein...

Just like mathematics, computer language, and esoteric studies, Biology contains encoded information in plain sight. That 4 simple molecules in our DNA control all the diversity in Life as we see it and may be seemingly linked through gradual evolution, or even the daily process in an organism from their DNA through to every protien-fxn they need in a day/life/life cycle is computationally mind-blowing and YES ALPHA-FOLD WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO A NEW FUTURE. Whew, See i just nerded-out too.",0
Ugz1BZrlCaPxyR038cp4AaABAg,"no, alpha fold did not &quot;solve&quot; protein folding. For starters, the protein folding problem is not &quot;Can I take a sequence to a 3D fold?&quot; The problem is &quot;Why/how does sequence result in that fold?&quot;<br><br>Secondly, if we look at the structure prediction problem (which is the problem they actually made progress on), they are nowhere close, they&#39;re just outperforming their academic counterparts. For instance, notice how they do not predict the structure of, say, a membrane protein, and also stick to a narrow range of globular enzymes. Proteins are wildly diverse and CASP has always been criticized for not being generalizeable.<br><br>Finally, structure prediction is not the premier problem of the field, the premier problem is refinement, which is the process needed to perfect the structures to the point where they are (debatably, I would say, as a harsh critic of theoretical molecular biophysics) usable in various scientific and engineering applications. Deep &quot;learning&quot; performs just as well here as it does many other disciplines of applied physics, which is to say abysmally.<br><br>Stop spreading fake news about fake science.

UgzGLDP06tc1BtHe7SN4AaABAg,"The &quot;Protein Folding Problem&quot; is no closer to being totally solved than Cold Fusion is to powering our homes. It appears what AlphaFold2 has been able to accomplish is a rapid and accurate simulation of a final conformational state of an enzyme protein CASP14. This is no easy feat, but the hype around this accomplishment misses all the protein folding dynamics, intermediate states, and binding sites and exploring ion channels (for pharmaceuticals to attach to) a protein actually has to go through, to get to the final state. This is still in the realm of long running simulations like you see on distributed computing projects such as Folding@home (or run on massive supercomputers). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23curecoin"">#Curecoin</a> is actually a cryptocurrency valued in the computational work required in simulating FULL protein folding dynamics.

UgzdT-6Zu0U_7yc6cTB4AaABAg,"I am a Canadian Masters Student in Computer Science and with a Bachelor Honors in Biochemistry. I actually just wrote a research proposal for a grant that was about the functional prediction from protein structure. So I have recently read up on this literature a bit. Not saying I am an expert though! I think the biggest implications are for protein engineering. Since proteins (Enzymes to be specific) are responsible for the metabolites of all living organisms, being able to design enzymes to produce natural products efficiently is incredible for the production of drugs and almost any other material tbh. Currently, there is literature on how to predict optimal binding sites, but turning that into a functional enzyme is tough. This takes lots of expensive iterations. This is because our prediction models are bad and predicting if proteins are stable to fold. Because models are trained on natural proteins that function the programs aren&#39;t great at telling us what is stable or not, just what a possible fold maybe. but with advancements like these, we will likely get closer to predicting the stability and function of proposed sequences making engineering a possibility. <br><br>Another huge implication is the possible discovery of uncultivatable proteins. A significant amount of biomass on earth cannot be grown in a lab. This leaves an ungodly amount of organisms and their components unstudied. But, the field of metagenomics takes DNA and RNA samples found from soil or other samples and reconstructs potential genomes. From genomes, we can predict possible amino acid sequences and from that, we can predict natural proteins that we would have never seen before!!!  There is always a risk that since the data is from organisms that are cultivatable that the proteins of others may be different in some way, but that is extremely unlikely to be an issue in my opinion. Very Exciting!! On top of this, if we can predict ligand/substrate binding then we can see natural biological compounds that we haven&#39;t seen in the lab before! Natural products have a high efficacy in drug discovery so this is fantastic!<br><br>Big things that still need to be done, in the field are stability prediction, function prediction, ligand/substrate binding prediction, product prediction, dynamic movement prediction for enzymes that go through conformational changes. Lots ahead, but breakthroughs like this make me super hopeful! <br><br>You&#39;re an inspiration Lex! I am hoping to make an impact on substrate/product prediction myself with applications of deep learning!",1

His work revolves around creating proteins(enzymes) that are high performant and can massively increase production efficiency for drugs/ingredients and etc. This means a huge amount of laborious lab testing the performance of many proteins they created from the ground up. Computational prediction of protein structures was a frequent topic of our casual discussions, with him often being pessimistic about it, saying that proteins are the most complex structures in the universe, and the combinations are infinitely endless, and that only a quantum computer can begin to qualify such a task. Because I work in I.T, I tend to console him with the notion that A.I algorithms these days are surprisingly powerful, and maybe more suitable for such endeavors. We&#39;ve had this type of dialogue for years. A few days ago when I sent him the news of this breakthrough he was in complete shock.

UgwyvHJd5-Oh1IX9Mzx4AaABAg,"Great presentation Lex, I think your poetics were very suited here!  In some ways it&#39;s poetics all the way down.  I&#39;m just waiting for the day that instead of applying analytical techniques, I can load up my dynamical systems and simulate.  Oh how I wish I could do that!  So please, please, cover alpha fold and explain it to us biologists!<br><br>I think you were spot on with your long-term goals.  It is one thing to predict a static protein structure, super important and will open up many hypothesis generating doors but really it&#39;ll be about simulating arbitrary molecular interactions.  I&#39;ll give one example because I find it so amazing.  I work on a type of molecule called microRNA.  They are RNA molecules about 22 nucleotides in length and they act as guides to help locate other RNA molecules within the cell.  They have a complex maturation process but last step, more or less, is the transfer of the microRNA molecule from one protein (DICER) to another (AGO).  When bound to DICER, the microRNA is in its double helical form, just like with DNA.  Then AGO comes along and it is shaped sort of like a globular boomerang.  AGO sticks to one end of one of the microRNA strand and then it &quot;grabs&quot; the other end.  To pull the strands apart and away from DICER, AGO initially is in a high energy state but after binding to the microRNA it sort of stretches out and not only separates the strands, but orients the microRNA so that it can perform its guide-like function, in one smooth movement (probably).  The result is AGO enters its lowest energy state and can remain stable for days!<br><br>It truly is amazing, if one day I could sit down and model potential dynamical scenarios of how this and many other interactions happen, it would be such a massive leap.  It gives me goosebumps...",0

This was such a well structured and explained video and I love your personality that goes with the explaining (the occasional poetic or philosophical thoughts). Thank you so much for this video!",13
UgzLejwPliXo5Xq3mTV4AaABAg,This is huge for AI and even Biology. However I do not now know what it means for the future of research as currently we get these in vivo protein shapes via crystallography. Perfecting the crystallization process with various perfect solutions and then also isolating the protein has been a challenge for the past 50 years. So by having a faster more accurate representation of the protein is HUGE and literally saves months to years on research. There has been much disconnect between the algorithm based protein folding techniques and to the real life actual shape of the protein.,0
