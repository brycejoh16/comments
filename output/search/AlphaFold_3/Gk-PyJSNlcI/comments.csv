Ugxw9fEiSl0kuBHRBTx4AaABAg,ELI5: Proteins basically work like a lock and key. We can&#39;t pick the lock if we don&#39;t know what the lock looks like. Alphafold attempts to give us an idea of what the lock looks like so we can better pick it.<br><br>Does a 5 year old even know about lock picking?,1

I&#39;m so scared of ever getting something like that and knowing that it could be eradicated would be such  reliev and so good for humanity. So much suffering and wasted time could be turned into productive and live-worthy lifetime. I&#39;m no english native - I hope you get my point. There is way more money and value in being healthy than in keeping people medicated!
