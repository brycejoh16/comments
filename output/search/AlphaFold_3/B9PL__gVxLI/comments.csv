So in the end I gave up.<br><br><br>Why don&#39;t you go through the paper and then re-arrange it the way you understand it.<br>Then write your own interpretation and keep improving it until you are fluent and know the road map for its presentation. <br><br>Or send me a link to some-one who has done it in a fluent and comprehensible presentation.,0

It just could be predicted when a protein remains in the cytosol, unaffected by any factors like oligomerization, disulphide linkage....Really unrealistic.

UgzCCPxpbUOqg9QTTsF4AaABAg,"I like this video - but about the hype of the news... I dont buy it - not yet - and probably never. We are living in the age of hypes (thats also the reason why crowdfounding games can gather hundreds of millions of dollars)... thats why &#39;&#39;hyperloop&#39;&#39; works, thats why &#39;&#39;solar freaking roadways&#39;&#39; works. I mean works as hype to get millions of dollars. Sure its not always about money - its often enough a matter of prestige - and i dont say , that AlphaFold2 didnt achieved what they claim. I only doubt the MEANING of this achievement. And now i want to say a bold arrogant claim: <br>Unless THIS achievement, DIDNT lead within 5 years into: healing cancer, healing parkinson, anti-age, healing alzheimer desease, etc etc , this &#39;&#39;AlphaFold2&#39;&#39;-zero means almost nothing. <br>Now, i know, thats tough - but they did also a tough claim with hype-words like &#39;&#39;breakthrough&#39;&#39; ...&#39;&#39;on a 50 year old problem&#39;&#39; ...&#39;&#39;we solved &#39;the thing&#39; which causes parkinson, alzheimer, cancer etc in the first place&#39;&#39; .. SO they have to deliver. <br>Now, why i am so arrogant about this... <br>On the one side, like i said before: because we are living in hype-ages, i am not easy to jump into a hype. <br>And second, if i do comparisons to REAL medical breakthroughs which deserve the word - lets say: the invention of antibiotics... Penicillin truly solved in 5 years, worldwide really a LOT (!) of deadly deseases... let it: syphillis, cholera, tuberkulosis, hepatitis, all sorts of inflammatory deseases, etc etc ... Sure i dont say it solved everything - and sure, i dont say it solved it for all eternity (multiresistent gems) , BUT it was really kind of an holy grail , and it spread within few years around the globe - within 5 years, with one hit, a big amount of deseases really was solved. <br>AND that, ladies and gentlemen was over 80 years ago - with a much less efficient pharma-industry, and much less logistic capacities, without computers , etc etc etc.. <br><br>SO if the hype of this so called &#39;&#39;breakthrough&#39;&#39; deserves the word  - then we will see real world benefits within 5 years... and i mean benefits which we hear all the time about protein-folding-predictions (healing parkinsons, healing alzheimer,etc)... and not just &#39;we can now make plants with glowing leaves&#39; - not that shit. <br>And because i feel, that everyone feels that this will not happen - and therefore a lot of people will defend it like &#39;&#39;science doesnt work that way... science needs time&#39;&#39; etc , they only admit, that they feel like me... that this isnt a breakthrough.

The Idea is that, train a network which reads the sequence of amino acids and predicts their distance. Stage 2 do the gradient descending in order to both generate something real spacial data in the form of vector3d and check if the prediction from stage 1 is possible. If it&#39;s not possible, let&#39;s say, distance(point 1,point 2) == 1, d(2,3)== 1,but d(1,3)== 3, the stage 2 has to deal with this, and gives out a result which fulfill all the distance prediction as possible.",1

The thing is, that atoms can rotate around a single covalent bond. The amino acid backbones, however, are connected in such a way, that a double bond is created (to be true, it is just a partial double bond, but this it not further important to get the point). Double bonds create an atom plane, in which the atoms are fixed and can no longer rotate individually. This is the case for connected amino acids. In detail, the center carbon atom, called C_alpha, is connected to two planes, one is the connection to the prior amino acid and the second the connection to the next one. The rotation angles of these plane in relation to the C_alpha are then the torsion angles. These are a direct result from the underlying chemistry and are used to describe structures since the birth of structural biology. If there wasn&#39;t a partial double bond, we would have a huge problem, since each protein would have even more angles we would have to consider (the side-chain angles are freely rotatable in most amino acids and lead to many many more possible combinations, but the backbone is more important and thankfully there are just two angles).",61
UgwQnDns1L7uDE9QbFB4AaABAg,"It seems to me that from the transformer embedding they go directly to the torsion predictions in the new model. And have de distance matrix an extra output, maybe just for training the transformer and concistency between de distance matrix and the torsion angles? <br><br>Im also wondering how transformers can be scaled to these very large amino acid sequences..",0
