UgwaCboaaeVCmzjhptd4AaABAg,"Good presentation, but does he really honestly believe that all these amazing proteins/machines on which life depends just happened to form by pure chance? And that they somehow came together under the same roof - in the same cell membrane and started to work together so that life could be born - by chance?   Hmmm. I bet that most atheists have no idea what miracles they are required to believe by their worldview. Which makes more sense here - Design or Chance? How is&quot; Chance&quot; a scientific explanation? Can it be tested? If not, is it science? Intelligent design as an answer to this protein problem and the origin of life is not permitted in their worldview so they are forced to believe in millions and millions of chance miracles. Yet, they claim they are the rational ones? Really? How rational is that?

There are roughly 7.5 billion people on the earth; if you had to randomly walk through that crowd you&#39;d not find your friend for decades, if even that.  However, even the simplest protein has at least 100 amino acids in the chain, and of those 100 slots there are 20 different choices. That&#39;s 1 chance in  20 with 100 zeros behind it that you will find your friend.  But there&#39;s more;  amino acids must form a chain in the correct sequence and then fold into the correct shape; if they don&#39;t fold they are useless which means you have to start the chain all over again, which means it&#39;s less like wading through a crowd of people to find your friend and more like selecting 100 numbers from 1-20 and hoping this will win the lottery.  Each time you lose, you must select your numbers again.  And that&#39;s only for a single protein.  The  most simple cell has at least dozens of proteins and they aren&#39;t just random; they all work together to perform dynamic functions. That means you&#39;d have to win this 100 to the 20th number lottery dozens of times at the same time in the same place.  There is no way this happens randomly. <br><br>Secondly, he suggests these amino acids are &quot;looking for their friends&quot; (according to the analogy he used).  That&#39;s not the case at all. Amino acids don&#39;t have friends and they don&#39;t try to do anything.  They are inert matter. To suggest that they are &quot;looking for their friends&quot; implies intelligence and purpose.  Looking for your friends is not a random process; you go into the crowd with the intention of finding your friend; you know what he looks like and he would recognize you.  If you want to say this process is  random (i.e. no intelligence) then you cannot use analogies or examples which imply purpose; that is cheating.",1

UgxtpZxhWHishW7C7n54AaABAg,"The question though is how you scale it up with regards to fuel. The fuel of proteins are ATP-molecules, which are very tiny molecules produced mostly in our mitochondria, that sort of function like a coin going into a slot-machine. But we really can&#39;t scale that up in size, not merely because we can&#39;t scale up individual atoms, but these ATP &quot;coins&quot; at the molecular level can float around everywhere randomly dispersed in the water because they are so tiny, but scale them up and they all just sink to the bottom and won&#39;t be able to get into the various slots that make them accomplish anything. In nature their very tinyness takes care of their distribution sort of for free, while getting bigger pellets of fuel distributed cannot be done for free. (This is indeed one of the reasons insects cannot get bigger than they do get, under our current oxygen levels there&#39;s only so far oxygen molecules will be naturally and sort of &#39;free of charge&#39; dispersed in a body without proper lungs and hearts and blood vessels, that cost energy to build, run and maintain).",1

Ugyeb1xtzJVw5RMEgpt4AaABAg,"the problem is that people see dna and proteins from a matter only perspective. the protein can&#39;t fold and unfold by itself. its not itself that is doing it. proteins need energy to transform. the medium is invovled in the change what ever molecules like water or other constitutents are involved. protein can&#39;t do anyting on its own without somthing invisible of energy present in the medium that organize it. it can not self organize. somthing have to change the electron charge balance in the medium. there is also tiny voltage potentials needed to drive the interactions. somthing external of energy have to iteract with the medium to drive the change of the shape of the protein. perhaps the protein could unfold or fold one time but it can&#39;t do this repeativly without a source of power.  the catalyst will at some point stop at a given energy. dna is not magic. the way this ted guy talks is like  complex molecules are magical structures that can transform themselves simply by being matter. the voltage potentials in the medium creates a interference pattern that treat the structure as a whole. any influence of random particles in the medium will affect the behavior of the whole. these particles either steal some electrons or gain electrons by interacting with the catalyst. the way these nao structures vehave acroding to the energy potentials in the medium is similar to the brain wave signal the brain produces by thinking. its not thinking like we do the catalyst is doing but somthing similar and much more simple. the whole brain produces a much more complex interference pattern of voltage potentials from a pattern of a whole to its individual parts don to the smallest contitutents of particles and energy driven motion. what these experts in genetics does nto seem to realize is that there is energy present that reprogram matter to redefine itself into more compexity. its the energy that brings the protein to life, not the atoms in it. we humans and any organic life is as much like a computer in the sence we need energy to be alive as the computer need energy to compute. actually the transistors in the computer is not computing energy. actually its the energy that is switching the transistors. the same goes for biology. its the pattern in the energy that computes the matter and not the other way around. the two need each other but are never separate from each other. its energy that makes organic matter alive. you take the energy out of the process and the catalyst stop as reaction have reached equalibrium and become dead. if we had instruments that was sensitive enough to listen into the medium of the protein, we chould be able to read fluctutation that directly correspond to its behavior just like a eeg read out does. this way we can probably program the medium to do stuff it was not intended from natures side to do.",0

Ugzg6iFLQhwUnO1mzgp4AaABAg,"This Ted talk was fascinating to me. Not only was it very interesting in itself, but it showed me a bigger picture. <br>   A handful of people in the world are advancing humanity&#39;s knowledge in ways that could not only improve our individual lives, but could restore our planet to a safe equilibrium point. Some of these people work in science, some of them work in art, etc., but there seem to be very few of them. The rest of us have other jobs or things that keep us busy. <br>   I need to adjust my life so that I am supporting people like this guy instead of doing nothing or even working against him by what I do and invest in. This life adjustment includes not only direct support where possible, but also by creating a more peaceful and loving environment among people so that people like this guy can do his work and so the rest of us can reach our potentials. For me, this means less TV, Facebook, and Avengers clips on YouTube, more thoughtful participation and encouragement of others so they can be the best they can be. <br>   I see so few reasons for hope when I read the news. This guy is a leader. He gives me the hope that if our society can survive the small-mindedness and selfishness of our current age, we may be able to save lives and our home by using the amazing gifts that God gave us.

Ugxz4VLFFyhUnkXcOJR4AaABAg,So heres the deal . Your are an electric motor... every chemical reaction that causes &quot; motion &quot; is initiated by a electron transfer.  A molecular key that fits perfectly in a protien right . Why does the key go in ? Because a difference in the ionic charge at that receptor vs<br> the molecule.... so it IS exactly like an electric motor in that it runs on electricity.... you just cant see the electron transfer/ current flow and you view it as chemical reduction or redox ... so why so different from an electric motor in what you can see ... electric motors do 1 thing ... spin cw /ccw.  You do many things in a 3d landscape.  But it is an electric motor,9

This gives a few extra zeroes to the exponent. On the other hand some amino acids can be swapped in the target protein fold without a change in the structure, but mathematically this has been an unsolvable problem so far since it&#39;s not always near the active site(s) where the protein destabilizes.<br>NOTE: there are more amino acids than what forms the life and there&#39;s still this assumption of just peptide bonds forming AND the reaction stability (in neutral water solution w/o ions) is not taken into account = no hydrolysis of the N‚ÄìC=O.

As scientists though, we have to resist coming to conclusions, especially based on  modeling that is limited by knowledge we don&#39;t yet have. Outcomes derived from today&#39;s inputs reflects the frontier of the next step function in new discoveries we cannot even fathom now. Just like our ancestors assigned &quot;God&quot; to anything they could not explain, the human condition still demands the same explanation today. If we can&#39;t explain something, even with the best reach of science today, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that we&#39;ve reached the end of the discovery process whereby that which we cannot comprehend MUST rest with the conclusion that we&#39;ve proven the existence of &quot;God.&quot;  It&#39;s typically abhorrent to any scientist of merit to now say &quot;It&#39;s settled, this is bona fide proof of God.&quot; I would assert that like our less enlightened ancestors, we are assigning &quot;God&quot; to something beyond our comprehension, and because it is beyond the current scientific reach we have today, we fall into the same trap of our ancestors -  Explaining those things we cannot comprehend to &quot;God.&quot; I&#39;m not saying God does not exist, for that would be drawing a conclusion of certainty, of infallibility. It was just 1917 that the Theory of Relativity was postulated. It is still being tested today, and admittedly, reaffirmed many times over the last 110 years. But what is yet to unfold over the next 110 years? We don&#39;t know. I would suspect, discoveries that are incomprehensible today will emerge, creating the next boundary of attainable knowledge, which in turn gives way to the next. And each time a limit, or even better, the next impossibility emerges, the unexplained will be assigned to &quot;God.&quot; My final thoughts... this cycle perpetuates through and transcends humanity for as long as mankind survives, never finding proof of &quot;God&quot;, but will predicably insert &quot;God&quot; for anything we don&#39;t fully understand.",0

Protein and all atoms and molecules function in the exact same way and he evaded that because this would allude to the concept of curing cancer in protein. I absolutely believe he is very aware of this. So treading on eggshells he only focused on the idea of motion as a type of energy which we already know about being used in the ocean and dams as well as wind energy.

A frequently asked question asked by those who believe in a designer is where did the <i>information</i> of life come from. Every living thing, down to the simplest archaeon, contains DNA - a chemical system of encoding the information necessary for that life form to function, survive, live and reproduce. Even the simplest living things require an <i>enormous</i> amount of information. This information must be read, processed, interpreted, executed, regulated, replicated. Instructions to build all the chemical machinery to accomplish all those functions must be encoded for within the DNA itself. This is quite circular in nature - no code without machines to process the code - no machines without the encoding necessary to make the machines.<br><br>To repeat - even the simplest living things require an <i>enormous</i> amount of information. I don&#39;t know how to convey how truly large the &quot;enormous&quot;  of the previous sentence is. The life form with the simplest DNA known is a bacterium that lives symbiotically in the gut of a flea and it contains a genome consisting of over 450,000 nucleotides. That&#39;s a lot of information. This bacterium can only exist and reproduce in a very, very special environment - much more special than a puddle of goo. I would hazard a guess that anything that came to life out of some primordial puddle would have to have an information encoding system that contained <i>at least</i> that amount of information, as a bare minimum (as well as the machinery to read it and execute it). Prior to that first living thing having <i>that amount information</i> and getting it <i>all</i> correct, there would be <i>no replication</i> and therefore no evolution.<br><br>Please, will <i>some</i> believer in abiogenesis try and hazard a guess as to how the co-spontaneous-generation of this great chunk of information together with its information processing machinery could happen?

Ugz17_65nxnmODl9cCB4AaABAg,"to all evolution religionists: Bio Chemistry has demolished your belief.  The video maker articulated why. Lets just look at DNA for a moment, leave aside RNAs. Micro RNAS, THE 20,000 &quot;machines&quot;, membranes, plasmas,  etc in each cell of which it is estimated exist in an estimated 90 to 100 trillion in the human body. A nanometre is one millionth of a millimetre and the average cell is reportedly 25  nanometres wide. In the centre is the nucleous about 10 nanometres diameter that houses, protects among other machines the DNA . biochemists say this is, with its spiral twists, coupled with nucleotides looped in circles called histones is scrunched therein. They go on to tell us DNA in humans has 3 billion base pairs of CODED INFORMATION, each cell has the blueprints to construct another human.( That would be 3 trillion humans). They further tell us when signals come from outside the nucleous( multiple times simultaneously) because proteins wear out after 2 or 3 months, machines that split the dna and another follows and copies the info in an incredibly complex fashion. They further tell us each machine knows exactly where to stop and start so that when they exit the multiple nuclear pores of the nucleous they will eventually end up via the protein factories to where the signals came from. <br><br>This is going on 24/7. It is now known, so they say, there are 5 different inspect and repair mechanisms traversing up and down the DNA or Genome even though they also say there is only about one copying error every 10,000 transcriptions. But here is the real evo debunker. No bio chemist will deny that the DNA in each cell if rolled out in a straight line will be 6 feet long! One gave an analogy to help realise what that means. He said it would be like trying to fit or scrunch string into a tennis ball forty miles long. When cell division is about to take place it assembles into 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome to continue the analogy would be at least 3 quarters of a mile long. All of that activity is going on in a space  you would need the most powerful electron or neutron microscope to see. To say this process is the result of blind &quot;natural selection and copying errors over a billion or so years&quot; is AN INSULT TO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

UgyTGWJ4Tik3cDy99Ul4AaABAg,"He covers the basics of what protein folding is while briefly mentioning the real factor for proteins. I do realize that his talk was more geared toward the possibility of replicating the folding, it‚Äôs important to mention why proteins even need to fold. Every protein has a job and that job is dictated by its structure. And that structure is dictated by certain chemical interactions either with itself and/or with other proteins. Amino acids are determined or coded from the nucleotide sequence ultimately originating from DNA. This accounts for what is called the primary structure of proteins. I&#39;m not aware of any proteins that stop at this point but progress onto secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structures. All of these subsequent structures are, again, determined by chemical interactions. But if for some reason the proteins folded incorrectly or quit folding all together before its final confirmation then that protein would not have any of its function rendering it useless. He does talk about the folding with the necklace metaphor but the reason being able to break down the protein is so important is, as I‚Äôve stated, structure is function. To illustrate, he refers to water channels within our cell membranes called aquaporins. If this protein does not fold correctly water is not allowed into the cell. Misfolding can happen in a variety of different ways. One that has been frequently tested on throughout my undergrad and graduate schooling is ‚Äúwhat happens when a hydrophobic amino acid is present on the inside of the water channel?‚Äù. Because water, the very basis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, will not interact with anything hydrophobic the cell goes without water and leads to eventual cell death. One cell in the sea of cells that make up our bodies doesn‚Äôt seem like a large loss but, what if this misfolding is perpetuated throughout all our body‚Äôs cells?

UggWuwZPKf4vgngCoAEC,This can&#39;t occur in without water as a sculptor of it&#39;s folding.,0
UgjhhGy00bhlungCoAEC,Actually the water assist in it&#39;s folding where appropriate force and counter-force channel the process down biased pathways through differential patterned microelectrocymatics.,0
UgiVAqLaT-RmvHgCoAEC,This also explains prions protein reproduction as the prions protein has a more stable or stronger microelectrocymatic frequency and the normal protein adopts it especially in the context of water memory.,0
UghPmD3_H5cECngCoAEC,So a microelectrocymatic protein molecule in a sea of microelectrocymatic water allows it&#39;s folding to take place and forces movements to make bonds and appropriate least energy movement&#39;s.,0
UggwhczcAaRoMHgCoAEC,"The solution is microelectrocymatics and quantum holographic memory of entangled states which provides a strong reference frame to conformation by self-organization(a kind of animated origami). This can include the fourth phase of water or metaliquid viscotone and it&#39;s memetic properties i.e. quantum memory. Microelectrocymatics is how every molecule has a unique patterned electromagnetic vibrational and ossilatory movements if you add the Casimir effect, which is a attraction towards first and second level entanglement. As it vibrates the signal is splayed out and forced back into itself, that forces the appropriate atomic bond linkages. Some proteins are better at this than others such chaporonins,vandalism others less so, which need a folding catalyst(chaporonin) to do so or it likely misfolds. Water itself has microelectrocymatic behavior and it can change based on past(precedence) activities, especially in it&#39;s fourth metaphase metaliquid viscotone. Water and it&#39;s molecules are entangled at multiple levels, the higher levels(atomic and molecular bonds, don&#39;t forget those shared bond are newly established entangled states with lower energies compared to past or primary ones)interfere with the more primary quantum and sub-quantum levels of entanglement. The addition of new entangled states requires entropic drive towards the warping of old space-time fabric to form new folds, like folding paper. These new warps or previous entangled states into new ones causes decoherence(interaction, increasing environmental complexity, and interference etc ), but once established they become coherent again and it cycles over again appearing as the arrow of time and seemingly chaos, disorder and complexity. This is a job first quantum biology folks and all chemistry is going to need it including the problem of abiogenesis and more. This can also explain quantum evolution and the origins of new genetic information or genetic syntropy(such as mutation hotspots, gene duplication, exon shuffling etc). DNA also has microelectrocymatic properties ,all molecules do!. Microelectrocymatics can also explain how some DNA sequences can cause specific nucleosomal positioning changes regulating gene expression affecting and being effected by histone modifications and other epigenetic dynamics.",1

UgiMiBDvtK6cFHgCoAEC,they look like Jesus&#39;¬†Grapes on a vine.,0
UgjzuAXI2QoKoXgCoAEC,"If anyone is interested the membrane protein at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm-3kovWpNQ&amp;t=628"">10:28</a> is an Aquaporin",5
UgjmHa--dZuKNHgCoAEC,"This is awesome, but it doesn&#39;t really address the protein folding problem, which is not how, but what and why?",0
UgjpvPuJZGdDungCoAEC,It&#39;s difficult to see how Brownian Motors (the mechanism by which these molecular machines work) will be able to be &quot;scaled up.&quot;,7
UginCOVgwW3kuXgCoAEC,Very educative indeed,0
Ugjo4xOhFcxYhHgCoAEC,"Why justice, why. U make yourself sound like a dumbass",3
Ugh3NltB4i5413gCoAEC,protein folding is madd lit SON what you mean its the GOOD GOOD PURPLE GANG FOR LIFE WE THE PURPLEEST PURPLE SCHOOL SHOUTOUT TO MR B FOR BEIN MAD CHILL AND TEACHING ABOUT CELLZ AND BODY PARTS HES MADDD CHILL HE SHOULD BE A SCIENCE PROFESSOR LIKE CMON HE SHOULD BE STACKIN MILLIONS BOIIIIIIIII,5
UgjMATKKhTkEZHgCoAEC,lets go new voices squad get money all day every day we the one and only living environment represent to the fullest. cash money justice doyle sign out doggg,1
UghZ01_-m7qgiHgCoAEC,"And all of these came about by chance of evolution lol... It takes intelligence to create machines.. Specially very advanced machines..Well, any kind of machine takes intelligence to create..¬†<br>The more I see the workings of anything living, makes me even more sure that there is an¬†intelligent mind behind it all..<br>A space shuttle hasnt even got the complexity of a living cell.. And these people expect me to believe that the universe created itself, and then live created itself.. Well, thats all bullshit..<br>Something or someone has created this living machine..And I tell you one thing, it was not chance that did it..",7
Ugi3RD-r4AwvUngCoAEC,Really cool video. I understand a lot more about proteins and why protein folding is important<br>,34
UggDCTkPPmStangCoAEC,"Thankew for the show,it helped me to understand the fact up to a mark",1
UghWuGBAbeVwTHgCoAEC,no body laughed at his jokes and I&#39;m sitting there getting weird looks in class for laughing¬†,133
UgjCJ0Ot6xiwEHgCoAEC,fantastic!,3
UgikelZJVKmVu3gCoAEC,"Good video. However, life isn&#39;t 3 billion years old people. Seriously how can anyone even think that this planet is that old.. ",0
Ugjdlgf7N36tzngCoAEC,"amazing talk, hope this gets more views! let&#39;s share it guys",12
UghcT4ReRUpbDXgCoAEC,"Good talk, also the nanotechnology can learn a lot from the technology in our cells.",3
UgxkyZGL8e4HCbKT98l4AaABAg,I love his book on statistical thermodynamics: Molecular driving forces,0
UgxDLdQ0K1js6A6OUDN4AaABAg,Something as complicated as these processes may only have been derived by a more complicated entity? A director? The problem is by that same exact logic the director is too complicated to exist with out a more complex director of it&#39;s own. And that new director needs a more complex director on to an explosion of more and more complicated directors into infinity. A complex director isn&#39;t a solution it just creates more questions.,7
UgwFbRZOKyaDBd2TMFp4AaABAg,"they didn&#39;t engineer themselves to produce abiogenesis they evolved after abiogenesis. the first replicating molecules were most likely ALOT simpler than these, something closer to viruses but probably even simpler, some suspect crystals, other expect rna, what ever the detail, it was simpler than these mechanisms... what you are seeing is a result of 3 BILLION yrs of modifications and selection to create apparent complexity (though it&#39;s really intricacy). But yeah it is mind blowing.",7
