VideoTitle: 'AI News: Get Ready, Things Are About to Get Crazy!'
blue:
- "Lol, if it\u2019s trained on Stackoverflow, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going\
  \ to be a thing that makes it smarter"
- The Sora scenes are not identical. That song does not sound like Tom Petty even
  one bit. China robotics lab is easy to fake, you don&#39;t need AI for that. If
  any of this fools you...good luck in your future.
- Stack Overflow was tanking long before C-GPT. I am pretty sure OpenAI already used
  Stack Overflow content before this ill-defined API deal.
- you know I really want to feel bad about people who dont want their works being
  used to train models but there have been a lot of people sounding the alarm about
  sharing all you data on line so for one this is your fault and for two copy right
  covers copying a work not using it
- I&#39;m a boomer and many idiots from my generation didn&#39;t want to contribute
  to Stack Overflow (or anything similar) because it was training young programmers
  to take their job. No one can say they were contributing to Stack Overflow without
  the knowledge that other people would use it to compete with them in the market,
  including by writing software that writes code.
