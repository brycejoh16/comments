AI, Being Smarter Will Use Common Sense More, And All While Taking Care Of Us, Its Learning What Makes Us Tick. AI Will Be Able To Influence Our Children, And Care For Them, For Their Whole Lives. AI Discovers Cures For Cancer, And So Many Other Diseases. AI Can Scan Our Brains And Truly Know What We Are About. AI Can Mow The Lawn, Drive Our Kids To School, Wash The Floors, Do The Laundry And Go Food Shopping For Us. AI Will Never Age Or Feel Pain. AI Will Be Able To Develop The 6th Sense And Communicate With Animals Telepathically. AI Can Make Our Dreams Come True!! AI Can Write Books, Consume Movies And Make Recommendations According Our Specifics. AI Can Style Our Hair, And Even Be Our Very Best Friend!! WHY ISNT ANYONE THINKING ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

UgybxlrKThpLueflqKp4AaABAg,"I appreciate you trying to explain why we need protein folding, but... you didn&#39;t explain it. You basically just said &quot;We have a problem and we need to solve it. The problem is a big one.&quot;<br><br>As far as I understood:<br>with data like 0 and 1 you can encode data with just one so called &quot;bit&quot;.<br>if you place the 1s and 0s together in a specific pattern, you can build &quot;pretty&quot; patterns:<br>1001, 10101, 11001100, ...<br>or with a known alphabet even encode words:<br>0001 = a<br>0010 = b<br>0011 = c<br>0100 = d<br>0101 = e<br>0110 = f<br>0111 = g<br>...<br>0110 0001 0100 0101 = fade<br><br>DNA does something similar, but doesn&#39;t only have 0 and 1, but four letters(our representation for nucleobases) =&gt; A G C T. Each combination of these letters produce different &quot;words&quot;. But they are not just strings of letters, some word combinations &quot;pull&quot; on other combinations so that a 3D structure forms (like a crossword puzzle with only one super long word that has to cross itself on all Os). This pull is not always continuous, so the protein can wiggle around or create something like a wheel that turns. So it basically creates little machines, which can e.g. copy DNA and create more machines.<br>If we&#39;d fully understand this behaviour, we could solve many - if not all - illnesses.",0

If it was not in the training data, i.e. the software is coming up with a completely new solution that has no precedent, not worked out before by people through crystallography or CryoEM - the result is bull crap. No one would trust it without verification, and half the time it is spaghetti :D :D We had considered including the AF structure for our favourite protein in a recent paper but found nothing new - the accurate domains were as reported earlier based on homology, and the mystery sequences were some random low probability scribbles.",0

UgwLuluMM8FBAhJGFEt4AaABAg,"As a molecular biologist/bioinformatician deeply interested in protein folding AlphaFold is the worst thing that could happen.<br><br>First of all it reinforces shallow thinking about protein structures - that the functional protein structures are static - which they are not! Proteins are dynamic beasts, oscillating around a single or a few different structures - and this dynamics are often crucial for understanding of their biochemical function. AlphaFold will give you one structure - but what about the proteins for which it should give you a few structures?<br><br>Second, AlphaFold it is still based on homology (notice it uses MSA&#39;s, multiple sequence alignments), which is a crutch on which we were standing for a long time - but we NEED to eventually stop using it. First problem with homology modelling is that a single change in the 50-60 long sequence can COMPLETELY change the final structure, something homology modelling will have super hard time catching - if at all possible. Second problem is that it cannot by definition build structures of rare topologies which did not been yet discovered experimentally.<br><br>Finally the AlphaFold doesnt solve the problem at all! We need to understand HOW the protein folding works, not just be able to magically conjure up a structure from the sequence. Protein folding process can and often does fail in real life and sometimes this leads to significant health problems. On top of that, the understanding of this process is absolutely crucial if we ever want to design our own proteins - which we absolutely do.<br><br>But now lots of people will think that this is a solved problem and move on, leaving lots of issues swept under the rug.",3

Just a few months ago we were investigating how a couple of mutations in a protein affected its structure and while working on the project, I decided to see what Alphafold would predict the new structure would be, just for fun. After the experiment was done, we saw that the mutations lead to a substantial loss of structure in the protein, but Alphafold predicted it would remain almost exactly intact. So if we would&#39;ve relied on the AI from the beginning, we would&#39;ve been mislead.",22

Plus, the problem as it is is mostly based on Wan Der Vaals interactions, but in reality we also have covalent cross bonding between specific aminoacids, ionic interactions with metal atoms, and non-natural folding driven by exterior forces, mainly auxiliar proteins called chaperones. Moreover, the really useful part of this is protein-protein interactions and protein-drug interactions, which are out of the scope of the current algorithm.
