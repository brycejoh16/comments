UgycUsmUNBfQ55F8vUl4AaABAg,"I have two peptides with 17 residues each, one is head to tail cyclic peptide and the other is stapled peptide. Does alphafold2 work with chemically modified peptides?",0
UgyUZ4WnqoXHxX4e8jJ4AaABAg,"Thank you. Please clear that the newly predicted structure in AlphaFold database needs to be validated through Ramachandra plot or needs to be refinement or not? Or can I directly use them for further docking procedures without refinement!?? (I&#39;ve seen the models after refinement clash score, molprobity is risen instead of lowered) Plz clarify me.",0
Ugy-WR0L6bgbm16Tpdd4AaABAg,I have a question I&#39;m trying to predict two proteins with the linker between but the alpha fold has a disk issue. I don&#39;t understand is about my disk because I have 1 tb space to use but when it makes model number 3 it start stopping. can you please describe this?,0
Ugx6p1mO7Y9nIe1lM_t4AaABAg,üôè thank you for this!,0
UgyEfzQYD4pRk--o8UZ4AaABAg,I&#39;ve  installed chimeraX (macos high sierra) but not show  structure prediction,2
UgwBxow7n_zHI1unaKp4AaABAg,Thank you so much for posting this. It was really user friendly and easy-to-follow. It also explained some of the &quot;insufficient GPU&quot; errors I was getting from the AlphaFold2 colab notebook. It is important (as you noted) to install the &quot;Daily Build&quot; &quot;chimerax-daily.exe&quot; file as AlphaFold wasn&#39;t added before the 1.2.5 release. Thank you!,3
Ugypmoq48qFi2O3_otF4AaABAg,Great video! Very informative.,0
Ugyb57G61855GhT8KBN4AaABAg,"Hi, just wondering - when a structure exists in PDB - does that structure not get used as a template for structure prediction?",0
UgxmClwOvop5ijX6Z-J4AaABAg,The video uses a sequence affiliated with a pre-existing PDB... anyway to use the same workflow with a protein sequence that does not have a PDB entry?,0
UgxDghbPxRyvH5yyfBl4AaABAg,"Hi, thank you for sharing this video. I am wondering if you plan to release v1.3 sometime soon. I think currently v1.2.5 is the available version of ChimeraX that doesn&#39;t utilize AlphaFold.",0
