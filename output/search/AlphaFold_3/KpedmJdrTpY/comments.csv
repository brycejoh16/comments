Ugzc5740UFJws7yYwq94AaABAg,"Letting an AI system generate random probabilities of shapes with the possibility of spitting out the shape folded correctly isn&#39;t solving anything.. We don&#39;t know why they fold that way, when, or how. This is just allowing us to see what the protein shape would be once folded - but the way it gets there is far from understood. Also, the team themselves have mentioned its only successful on a small subset of proteins. A solution that works for some but not all with no rules isn&#39;t a solution either. This is decent for building a company around feeding data into a python application to train, but not exciting at all.
