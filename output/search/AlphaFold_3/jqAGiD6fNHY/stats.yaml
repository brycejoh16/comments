blue:
- hellow Ai search tool is there any text to image generator for free
- Is there anything AI related for hardware development? I mean, RTL development like
  systemverilog in microelectronic?
- What could we potentially do with knowledge on all the proteins/shapes that are
  possible?
- the risk posed by artificial pathogens is much more concrete than the risk posed
  by artificial intelligence
- "This is interesting but it won\u2019t be good until I can use it off-line and locally.\
  \ I\u2019m willing to pay a one time fee, I\u2019m not interested in an online service\
  \ neither is a great many other people. This is why stable diffusion did so well,\
  \ you could use it locally and off-line."
