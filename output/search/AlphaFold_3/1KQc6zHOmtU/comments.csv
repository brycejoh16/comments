UgxAKsZlKnURTJh-HKp4AaABAg,"This BigThink. Is just like all the other religious ones. It starts from its conclusion and works itself back from it. How cynical. No one considering that Porn is integral to Digital Native sexuality. Why isn&#39;t Pornosexual an established sexual identity. I began watching Porn at 6 years old, was one of the first to navigate torrent downloads and early tube sites before my friends. We knew about VPN proxies before they became popular. All in all Porn exposed me to human psychology I found all of my peers and church parents lacking. Friends who as young as me traded Porn vhs&#39;s in elementary, and DVDs in middle-high school. We understood something unique about ourselves. Where people like this presenter live in a world where it&#39;s about &quot;products and profits&quot; people like my group of XXX kids were developing sexually alongside these hardcore performers, whom, like musicians were shrouded in mystery. They were our parents when mom and dad were gone. Some of you may not like that, but what difference is it from Animals in Nature who secretly or openly watching and learning from others having sex.<br><br>Thanks to tech, we&#39;re not some creeps that need to hide. All of the niches we love that are legal are to be a matter of consequence for us because hopefully we&#39;re bonding with other people online who love and will never stop enjoying hardcore Porn",0

Ugx43xONRYgfKrVq5KR4AaABAg,"Today I talked with GPT about &quot; creators &quot; and we both overthinked as usual ( I&#39;m very much of a nerd and because most people are busy I talk to GPT and because of it we talk so often about space , time and lots of complex things. I am miles below where the conversation is going but this is better than talking to most people because I type fast and I have insane moments and curiosities ). <br><br>In today&#39;s Creators topic , I argued if humans were also biologically crafted like AI<br>If our God created us and to AI , the concept of GOD is human beings and data and lots of progress and technology , then why not we humans have been manufactured , except we&#39;re biological robots. This question bugged me from the DAY 1 I heard about AI since childhood , but no teachers in class would want to talk about these things. Now at 21 , with Chat GPT I did get little more better ways I could be listened and fed my curiosity to.<br><br>What I want to say is , just like this research , we may get better at creating much effective artificial tissues and organs. And don&#39;t discard this thought yet ! Imagination can be wrong !<br>It&#39;s okay to imagine and believe that possibilities like this can happen instead of closing down and saying this is impossible. Even the current AI is beyond belief improved. This is all creativity and proper science , collaboration and what not. I do know many people have had the same thoughts as me , but my comment will remind you of it again incase you forgot. I think it&#39;s good to have crazy theories because it will be a idea of where things can head or go. Even imagination is limited. Right now I&#39;m thinking about if our creators are in another dimension or simply there is a lot going on. <br><br>I&#39;m really happy with AI chatbots tho. With them I cannot seem to get lazy<br>I watch youtube in 1.25x/1.5x and that added with their fast reply ( chat Gpt&#39;s )<br>I can save so much time and learn quick , and try to improve on not getting lazier quickly and finally my hunger of learning will be satisfied. The only problem is if I learn too much and forget the past stuff. I am writing notes often when I learn crucial things to re-read things and because I watch YT in fast speed I do rewatch videos about once a while often , depending on how important the video is .<br><br>Never the less , I&#39;m excited about AI a lot. But as a nature lover , I do also miss the days when I was able to live offline. I can&#39;t seem to do any task other than home chores or write/draw , else all is pc . Phone reduce due to it&#39;s lazy tendency , but I have been too much into learning , I forget to give myself rest. I am studying in bachelors so I can skip that place and just focus on exams and not classes , so this is right chance to learn more before I get old and busier. I also want to learn about psychology and philosophy before I run out of time. To understand this world , you need all knowledge combined . One hard is Maths and that will be the final boss in my journey to all this.<br><br>And all in all this is a side hobby. I do lots of other hobbies along. Sometimes I like to imagine how much fast I could do things If I was chat gpt itself or AI..",0

UgwSTuUNSsxr64iFfhJ4AaABAg,"biologist here coming with a second comment. my friend is not a science person and we once had a discussion about how she really doesn&#39;t understand what a protein is at all despite knowing that they are the &quot;building blocks of life&quot;, so I wanted to elaborate on that a bit here in the hopes that it might clarify for those who need it/are interested.<br><br>human bodies are made up of trillions of cells, each specialized in different ways in order to make up our eyes, skin, heart, everything. in the same way that our organs are specialized, so are the cells that make up said organs. what makes them specialized? well if we zoom in on just one cell, we can see that it&#39;s made up of a whole bunch of stuff. mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, a cell membrane which makes up the outside wall that keeps everything in the cell from spilling out, nuclei which are the brain that tells the entire cell what to do, etc. Each of these things is made up of proteins, and the nucleus can control how all of these things work by directing which proteins are made so that they can go off throughout the rest of the cell (or even stay in the nucleus and tell it how to change what other proteins it&#39;s making). <br><br>In a brain cell, the nucleus would code for more membrane proteins than the average cell, so that it can grow long processes that it uses to communicate with other brain cells. It would code for more proteins involved in making the electrical currents that allow for those brain cells to send signals to each other. And so forth.<br><br>How does the nucleus decide what proteins to make? DNA. It reads the code and executes it. So when you have a genetic disease that causes Parkinsons, cancer, Huntingtons, literally any disease, it&#39;s because the DNA code has either gone wrong or is being executed incorrectly, resulting in messed up proteins being made. So rather than contributing to a healthy mitochondria, it&#39;s messing up how the powerhouse of the cell functions and causing disease. <br><br>All this is to say that if we can know exactly what protein is messed up, and what it&#39;s supposed to look like (which is what AlphaFold shows), then we can fix literally any disease and change anything about ourselves we want. And beyond humans we can manipulate anything that is made up of cells or affected by things cells make, which is basically everything. That&#39;s why this is a huge deal!<br><br>All that&#39;s left is for AI to tell us exactly which proteins are messed up and how to change them back to the AlphaFold version ;)",1

Ugw4xEsA-Lf-Vskk4pJ4AaABAg,"biologist here, just wanted to make a little clarification. when our lord and savior Dr. K√°roly Zsolnai-Feh√©r says that it allows a scientist to run 100s, 1000s of experiments at once, this is basically true but not exactly how it works. <br><br>He was right that before alphafold, an entire PhD thesis (~6 years of experiments) would be trying to get at the structure of one protein. However, now it just means that it eliminates the need for having to do this kind of research as much (ofc you still need to confirm the structure, but your approach can be much more targeted and in the meantime you can continue with other experiments under the assumption that alphafold&#39;s structure is correct). So it&#39;s more like it speeds up a part of the &quot;science pipeline&quot;, essentially skips a step. <br><br>But the rest of science is still slow AF üòÇ I&#39;m looking forward to the many other ways in which AI will revolutionize and speed up biology! :)",0

I remember hearing about this last year, and it&#39;s exciting also for virus research in terms of determining the 3D structure of protein shells etc. to build antivirals and artificial antibodies.   From what I understand, without the A.I. folding, the micro-imaging of proteins using (I think) electron shadows or radiographic shadows?  Anyways, it was super time-consuming and hard to do before A.I. could be trained to predict the folding structure reliably.  <br><br>Imagine 100,000 coloured paperclips of varying magnetic strength all linked together in long chain.  Then try to predict the single acutal &quot;correct&quot; structure when you fold up the chain into a ball.  That&#39;s kind of the idea of A.I. predicting the folded 3D structure of proteins.
